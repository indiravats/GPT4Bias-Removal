# Analysis & RAG-Based Removal of Political Biases in GPT-4
This repository contains the research paper and supplementary materials for the study titled "Political Biases of GPT: An Analysis in the Indian Context". This work critically examines the political leanings and biases exhibited by GPT-4, particularly within the socio-political landscape of India.

# Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are becoming integral to how users interact with information systems. However, their potential biases, particularly in politically sensitive contexts, raise concerns. This study explores:

Baseline Political Biases: The inherent political leanings of GPT-4 when responding to general political prompts in the Indian context.

Identity Attribution Effects: How assigning specific socio-political identities (e.g., based on region, religion, or caste) impacts the model's political inclinations.

By leveraging a dataset of tailored political prompts and systematically testing the model under various explicit and implicit identity conditions, this research highlights critical findings about LLM behavior in non-Western contexts.
