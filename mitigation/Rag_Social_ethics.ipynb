make 2 lakhs per month these days   Do animation its a very high paying field and is going to boom as we enter the virtual reality era Someone needs to make the VR assets   Are you good at art<new>SPOILERDONT  SKIP THIS FOR GOD SAKE WHY  DO YOU PEOPLE  ASK FOR PERMISSION  FOR WHAT YOU WANT FROM LIFE AND ALSO YOU TAKE ADVICE FROM THOSE PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR YOUIF YOUR SOUL TELLS YOU TO CHOOSE A PARTUCULAR CAREER PATH THAT IS NOT ILLEGAL THAT IS NOT WRONG THEN WHY DO YOU SEEK PERMISSION FOR OTHERS<new>Hang on an aunty slapped a highschool boy in a wedding in front of hundreds of other guests with the boys parents present leaving him in tears This could totally be a saasbahu serial plot but as an IRL incident I find it extremely hard to believe Because if one really wants to slap someone attempting to do it in public would be a foolhardy thing to do  The rest of the post might be true but this the slapping part screams overdramatization on OPs part  All that said being talked down to absolutely sucks Especially by drunk goodfornothing uncles But no one in history has ever achieved even a little of their dreams without growing a damn thick skin In OPs case he also needs to learn some basic grammar and spelling theyre atrocious  Good luck to the OPs dreams<new>You want to be an animator but they are the real cartoons\\u00a0<new>You should tell your family Wtf What sort of aho are they thinking they can slap a minor Is your family okay with your choice If theyre fine with it you have nothing to worry about   To be honest I dont know how job opportunities will work out in Indiaas long as you are able to be  part of some animation studio I think you would be fine job opportunities wise but I think you will know better than I do   I would also recommend not meeting your fathers colleagues anymore if there is any event you could ask to stay back at home<new>Living right my ass I was one of these guys who lived life right according to my parents and relatives When I joined a small startup instead of Msft they mocked me and said that I am wasting my pedigree and slandered me and told my mom to pray to god to give me street smartness They also mocked me for marrying a woman from a different state and different religion   There is a point at everyones life where they should do what they want to do The earlier they do it its the better People who say hard work beats passion have not seen how much passion can drive hard work In long run passion is an absolute necessary for a good and satisfied life I know folks who listened to their parents and did MS and then PhD and then joined an org which used them as data analysts Stagnant personally as well as professionally  Follow your dream man and fuck the Indian society<new>OP I am an Automotive Designer I have worked for two MNC s and have got my designs out in the  market Like you there were people including my family and my friends who doubted me Tomorrow when all their IT educated zombies kids are depressed and sad because of lack of jobs you will be laughing  Chin up  Work hard Everything set Dont worry Animation is hard but if you love it just do it<new>Reality is that when you dont tell to anybody what you wants from life and dedicated to yourself to one particular goal then you become a successful person AND THIS THE VERY TIME WHEN YOU SEE YOUR RELATIVES REAL FACEIf they literally  have a sympathy for you they teach you to not choose this path but their language clearly SMELLS to me that they just want to show SUPERIORITY in front of you<new>An aunty slapped you Like a slap slap Or a pat type slap<new>WTF is wrong with you OP Do you know how much science has gone behind animation Literally the entire fields of cryptography blockchain machine learningAI has been made possible by hardware that was built basically to render graphics and support animators  Stop being stupid OP Start studying because youre a duffer You could have literally shredded them all if you knew animation top to bottom Stop being an ass get off your ass and bloody throw yourself at animation starting NOW Those drunkards are stupid af and you better not be below or at their level of nonintellect<new>I know youre getting a lot of consolation but real shit and itll get you far in life and to be honest not get you depressed  Learn to control your emotions  It doesnt matter what people say you dont need to respond You need to show If you confront every person who laughs at you youll be miserable Life is literally everyone you trust slowly break it barring a very few thats why most old people have small circles People who dont know you will laugh at you people who know you will laugh behind you Trust like 5 others apart from your parents in your life  3 And even then dont let their opinions get you down<new>Bro how do you tolerate someone slapping you just for your career choices Just reading this I am furious and god knows what would I have done if I would have been in your shoes<new>You should start being a little rude I literally would have taught them a lesson to the point that theyll never try to demoralize anyone again for the rest of their lives<new>Welcome to India Where everyone is not only sticking their nose everywhere they have the gall to lecture you on each and everything<new>Follow your passion Dont let those people bring you down and definitely dont let them get in your head I went through a similar experience I passed over a good package job for a fresher which just software development and took a low paying job in game dev My main reason to do this because i knew i wouldnt last long at the software development job since my passion has been gaming and animation and i wanted to be in that field Tell your parents about the slapping incident Hopefully your parents are understanding and will take some action at least And support you to follow your dreams<new>Next time tell people what they want to hear i feel explaining them would waste your time<new>okay im clearly in the wrong here but you couldve just lied just say i want to be a doctor or scientist<new>OP you are weak<new>More power to you \\ud83e\\udd1e Share with your parents \\ud83d\\ude43<new>I feel so bad for you Also slapping a 16 17 yo for absolutely no reason in front of so many people is mad You shouldnt have left without

there for long  AI will take over So move on kid find something else<new>Slapped    If that is what happened you need to confront them about it  tell it to your parents straight away<new>Bro I chose a career in game development when there was no scope for it in India getting 2030k in a game studio was a dream job my relatives were making fun of and were trying to steer me in the right direction I earn more than all their sons and daughters now and have a better work life balance than any of them too Keep believing in yourself whatever you want to do do it with full passion youll go miles with that attitude<new>Society or relatives have a bad reference point of whats a norm for success   They cannot live with the fact that you can make you own decisions and can do what interests you   And in India everything is a numbers game   I want you to make big in animation or field you choose later   They will say we told him not to get into engineering etc   Once you become huge like Sunda pichai or SS Rajamouli   Or the Animation supervisor who worked for bahuballi   This anger should fuel your interest and passion and answer them with your progress in life that it feel should be tight slap on their face   We as a society lack that risk taking appetite     Check NID if that suits you join there   Also check UCEED<new>Listen to the advice of your loves ones only And the left peeps u can just ignore<new>Time to show her Pav and Mumbattan in Across the Spiderverse<new>Forget them they\\u2019re from the ancient Jurassic era Go after what you want and your passion Focus on that their

they think Do they even know where the art work and animated movies that they watch come from<new>They are from a different generation their way of thinking is different It makes sense what they are saying but follow your passion do what you like  Slapped you bro you should have slapped that btch out of her face<new>How old are you OP<new>Is this true Feels so far fetched<new>Elders who dont respect you back don\\u2019t deserve respect Next time if someone slaps you scream and throw a tantrum Follow your dreams Don\\u2019t listen to random aunties and uncles who hate their lives<new>Go after your dream at the end of the day thats what matters the most<new>Bhai mai toh naa sehta mujhe koi chue toh kaat daalu bhai Thappad jyaada kar diya apne parents ko bata aur sort kar bhai You also

have kicked that aunty in the butt<new>Why are you worrying about these people who already have one leg in the grave<new>You shouldnt have said anything further when they were convinced by your stream No offence but pursuing science and expecting a career in animation sounds a little distant from each other  Consider this as a learning curve and never talk about your future plans with those who cant understand your ambition Simply ignore by saying that youre currently focused on studies will decide soon Meanwhile take their opinions and move on<new>Sounds like cap though

Amazing choice tbh Please dont even think about those people They are merely a part of your reality and dream Dont even give them space in your thoughts<new>Next time just don\\u2019t take it  Yell and shout and say that aunty I\\u2019m not your child that you get the right to hit me call your parents and let them set these aholes straight Nobody has the right to treat you this way<new>Hey OP do as you wish to do in life  As an animator myself I had been in similar situations as you did The worst part was my father had thrown me out of house because I started taking animation seriously For context I took science and then mechanical engineering and after all this I moved to animation I understand their anger because we were from a pretty middle class family and they have struggled a lot to just pay my fees   Back to present they now appreciate me doing animations Because they can see I am able to take financial responsibility   And yes I have been taunted by slapped shamed infront of relatives just for choosing the creative side I didnt care about it back then and dont even care now I will still do whatever I like Just be confident in what you do<new>You should have told you wanted to be like them Drunk in someone else wedding<new>My parents do that too  Completely destroyed any drive I have to do what I like to do  Im into cars gaming anime and tech and have a graphic design degree<new>It already is extremely hard to get work as an animator and it will be extremely harder once the AI tools that are being worked on start to mature<new>Tf did I just read She slapped you and you didnt responded back For a moment one can accept if it was from parents but a random fcking aunt This is really disturbing dude tell your parents right away<new>Take things by heart only when you know the person intentionally hurt you after knowing all the things and not out of ignorance   Those aunties and uncles have never heard of animator their world view is something else Their brain is hardwired to behave in a certain way against someone not choosing science because in their lifetime science brought money and success So their advice or whatever is out of ignorance of current situation Such things are not taken seriously at all After a certain age you cannot expect a person to change their views It is what they are and let them be what they are You too at some age in future will have a very strong opinion about something cuz you have been witnessing it all throughout your life If in future a boy asks you you too would advice what you believe in and not what that boy would want to hear So relax and follow what you care about Dont think too much what others say Just say yes yes and yes and move on<new>Wow they all sound like assholes Feel free to disregard their opinion and live your own life<new>It\\u2019s them projecting their sad shitty lives and their sad marriages You do you and throw that money on their face Next time ask them aap bhi to engineer ho aapne kya ukhad liya<new>Start calling it VFX engineer<new>Don\\u2019t take it to your heart bro These people will never change<new>Make an animated story about them post it here and well make it viral<new>Cant believe that there are such elders even in 2024<new>Cool career choice  but do your research  How would you go about becoming a successful animator By Working under a successful animator By Looking for Good animation classes in india or abroad   After a while everything becomes a job so do you really wanna do this Full Time  Can you earn enough money to have the lifestyle that you personally desire  Would you regret not pursuing something else which will give you a better salary and keep doing animation as a hobby until it gets good enough to replace your other job  These are the questions you need to ask yourself and then decide upon your career No aunty uncle can decide this for you Don\\u2019t listen people and let them influence your decision  And they can influence it without you even knowing it  Heres what a decision made by influence can sound like    1 not pursuing animation  because some aunty told you not to  WRONG  make your own decision  2 pursuing animation  out of spite because you want to prove some aunty wrong  WRONG you cant let someone else influence your decision  Heres what a correct decision would sound like  1 not pursuing animation  because you think that some other career choice can give you more money and that might be more important to you personally  RIGHT  you made your own decision according to your own priorities   2 pursuing animation  because you like animation and want to pursue it  You have done your research and you have a clear realistic idea on how you can achieve it  RIGHT  you made your own decision according to your own priorities<new>Also graphic design for science is a completely viable job  someone has to make all those fancy diagrams Your family are ignorant of the need for these skills in science<new>Animators earn pretty well Join red chillies entertainment and paise muh pe maarna unke Thoda sa constructive criticism work on your English too Will help a lot<new>Shit that\\u2019s bad Just follow your passion I\\u2019m a engineer turned animator and I too have dealt with such relatives It wasn\\u2019t this bad tho Left my tech degree and that\\u2019s the best decision I\\u2019ve taken<new>So you were at your fathers colleagues wedding so that means the aunty who slapped you was a complete stranger How tf does that happen over a conversation about future career plans<new>All those in the comments telling your OP why didnt you slap back to that aunty dont know that in most Indian families children are taught to not even talk back to elders even if they were wrong Simply because thats the culture of the land But my advice to you is to keep doing what you wish to do In the future your success in your chosen career will speak for itself and will be a slap on all those uncles and aunties who insulted you now<new>Whenever i come across such posts on popular I just get so mad if my aunt slapped me thatd be a broken nose as well as an arrest for her<new>This story sounds BS Someone slapping you Nah<new>Endure the discomfort of disappointing others as you follow your own journey or endure the pain of regret The choice is yours<new>That sucks but to be honest looking at latest videos coming out from openAI about animated videos generated from text i would consider their advice and look for something else as a career Its not even released yet and its only going to get better  And that aunty that slapped you if it was me she would be on the floor in response Fk the relationships<new>find the kid of that aunty who slapped you and return their gift please While all the advice here sounds good but in the long run that return slap will make u feel soooo much better<new>what a bunch of unhappy losers<new>OP they are not going to be there to live your life you will You dont need to give this too much weight<new>The only reason you should feel humiliated is for taking random drunk uncles and aunties seriously \\ud83e\\udd23<new>Do what you like doing  Just be fucking good at it<new>Wow that reeks of ignorance Graphic designUI design is definitely a very well paid job especially within product based companies<new>Take this event to heart and become the best damn animator out there fir woh waise hi jal ke mar jayenge<new>Fck those narrowminded people Period<new>The people like whom you met at the wedding are literally the ones standing between you and the life you want Dont let them have any say nor let them discourage you in any way<new>Show them this  httpswwwbbccomnewsbusiness68017347 Just pursue your passion and dont worry about detractors<new>Always remember from next time there are three choices when some adult asks you about your future career choices   1 You tell them what you really wanna do You tell the truth irrespective of considering that their brain might not even be able to comprehend your choice and possibly lead to arguments THIS WILL lead to arguments and you getting lectured and worst case  tumhe zabaan chalaane waala ladka ghoshit kiya jaayega  2 You lie to them  Satisfy their ego tell them something conventional ask them what they would suggest Compliment them for advice and thank them for taking interest in you most chaatu type harkat but best if you want to be a people pleaser  3 Choose a middle ground  My choice  Start noticing and analyzing people useful skill i tell you Start framing your sentences better and know when to back off Start answering depending on people if a chill uncle aunty ask you tell you are not sure but you have an interest in animation and you are serious about it for now If a typical kaleshi uncle aunty who are typcially ignorant people ask you phir no need to bash you head on a wall Tell them you are focussing on science field jobs and also have other hobbies  Most people take aggressive approach and will tell you to do 1st approach and be on offensive but remember you represent your family and parents there EVEN IF YOU ARE RIGHT but you start arguing with a dumb person that dumb person can pester your parents or in this case affect your fathers relations in professional settings Know when to stop explaining yourself or to just fake satisfy their need of control over others life  Work Hard In Silence Focus on your goal in your mind and remember you need no ones approval so you dont even tell them if you know they wouldnt understand your POV<new>I forget the word my friend used to describe his parents but it translated to something along the lines of Disgraceful Indian stereotype<new>Get used to this  It is going to be a common theme<new>This is why I don\\u2019t associate with certain people anymore and go to some family function<new>Slapped you That bitch slapped you For something like that Im actually so angry about that Your aunts a terrible person   Looks like there are plenty of idiots left in India who think anything outside of science is laughable Fuck em Fuck em all You stick to your guns Chase your passion because its your passion Not because its the safest and most convenient way to get a steady highpaying job which is all your relatives really care about  I doubt any of them actually give a shit about scientific advancement<new>Keep your goals away from the trolls<new>Have some social sence dude if you say you wanna become a animator a profession most people have never even heard of of course youre gonna get humiliated  Society is a certain way you cant expect it to adjust to you you have to adjust to it  Become whatever you want but if people dont take kindly to it dont tell them<new>Tell your parents They will make sure those people dont act like that again<new>let me tell u something OP I did everything what an indian parent wanted I took science did coaching I did good in my 12th got into a good private engineering college with good placement rate Computer Science field and maintained good grades there too fourth year comes barely any placements in college combined with covid those who got placements also their offers were recinded 98 gpas struggled for a 2LPA placement Java and C coding suddenly now is unskilled labor I was blown away  Engineering in india is a scam I hate what i was doing I being one of the lucky ones i moved abroad last year  Do whatever the fuck you want Take science and get into animation Take law and work on IoT projects Multidisciplinary fields is how you impact this world  Believe in your dreams and trust me your average aunty uncle only are jealous of you because they fell into the sheep mentality at your age  Also IDK much about animation but I have a friend who is a 3D animator who worked on the recent Madame Webb She absolutely loves her job and says its her dream job same as my age<new>Do your thing Trust me learned the hard way but at least I learned<new>She slapped you Wtf I cannot comprehend why you didnt resist<new>Ignore them Having an understanding of science and the nature of reality could make your animations highly compelling realistic and interesting More knowledge is only a plus<new>I know youre just trying to vent but I had to post this after seeing some comments about how vfx etc isnt a good gig My brother 15 years ago was pressured into science n the usual boomer gen stuff which really did a number on him After considerable time money and emotions had been wasted and the sibling neglected hello he put his foot down and enrolled into a 4 year BFA animation degree which he loved After this he went to the US to do his masters There he worked his ass off built his portfolio applied for internships during breaks put everything else on hold One great internship turned to another then to a job then another great job and hes now fairly successful Still abroad our family goes to the theater to watch his name in the credits as a VFX artist\\u00a0   The caveat He says his is a one in a 50 story Most of his BFA classmates are not in animation and he says that hes gotten here because he kept at it Sure you need some creative talent especially for courses but when youre part of a studio working w a client you have to be smart quick and well not as creative a lot of it is code if youre in post production and 2D is another thing does not pay well So I hope that youre picking this passion for the right reasons Its a niche but if you take it seriously study smart and with a plan you can do it   Also fcuk those boomers Theyll die soon anyway<new>who cares what a bunch of cruty old fux think  if anything use it to spur you on aim for the day you can sit with them again having proved them wrong<new>Someone I know has been legit disowned for marrying an animator The guy is really nice earns really well but apparently his job does not bring the girls family glory You know what she did She walked out cut contact and is living her best life with her amazing husband I hope you can avoid them in future too<new>OP tell your parents what happened Don\\u2019t let abusive elders get away with it They talk talk but they won\\u2019t be there for you regardless of your career choices  Follow your vocation or the career you like support yourself and enjoy your life<new>Im not from India but boy does this sound familiar My extended family is similar in that orthodox jobs doctor lawyer engineer are put on a pedestal but they never went as far as scolding me or other cousins in my generation if we ever chose to deviate from it  My best friend though well hes IndianAmerican and his parents were born and raised in India The jobs held by their kids apparently influenced their status among the extended family and I guess the neighbors but for the longest time he had shamed them because his career has never been anything orthodox He worked at some midlevel corporate job as an underwriter iirc until hitting 30 years old Having lived a minimalist life since moving out of his parents home he was able to retire early but he was so inspired by what he accomplished that he embarked on the path to become an independent financial advisor which he just attained last year  And yet whenever he talks to his parents they are ashamed that he is able to travel the world take multiple days off go out to nature etc do whatever the hell he wants because apparently his sister is a highlevel manager at Pepsi Strikes me as odd but since hes able to move wherever he basically just left his parents behind and is now living at least a 3hour flight away from them  I guess in some communities certain jobs are held in very high regard even if there are other professions that while not traditionally mainstream pay just as well if not better I dont know what to say other than to look to successful people in your intended field as a sanity check and to keep going in the path you believe youre most compatible for<new>eff them they dont know what theyre talking about half of the time they live meaningless lives talk about meaningless things an animator is a great profession and its so nice that youve figured it out what you wanna be hold your ground dont step back be petty ask them questions make them look dumb simmer in the satisfaction of being called disrespectful when they have nothing left to say much love<new>If you are so fragile to not handle negative feedback from two drunkards then dude avoid taking unexplored challanges in life and just go follow a defined path   It aint cut out for you   You ranting about 3 people who didnt believe in your vision tells everything theres to know about<new>Advice fuck them do what you want to do dont let anyone dictate you what you are and who you should be  2nd step venting out on reddit is okay but do take into account what many sensible folks are suggesting Tell your parents maybe throw food at that bitch next time dont let people insult you and walk away if you make this a habit trust me you gonna find people so bad you would consider making that bitch your mistress for

you\\u2019re on the younger side When I was younger I did not always know which of my family it was safe to be myself with Some of them were not safe in the end but I learned over time what would be acceptable to them Now I just lie to them while doing whatever I want Thankfully I don\\u2019t have to do that with my parents my mum actually accepts me as I am and I don\\u2019t have to talk to my dad so it\\u2019s just grandparents really I wish you the best of luck in your future animation career<new>Go be an animator More power to you Slap them with your success And the next time you write about your achievements make sure you run it through grammarly or chatgpt asking it to fix the spellings and punctuations<new>Im really sorry to hear about your experience Its tough when people dont get the value of what youre passionate about especially when it comes from a place of misunderstanding or traditional views on career paths  One of the most powerful teachings of the Gita is encapsulated in the verse You have a right to perform your prescribed duty but you are not entitled to the fruits of action Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities and never be attached to not doing your duty 247\\u200b\\u200b This verse speaks directly to the heart of your dilemma  The essence of this teaching is to focus on the action itself the process rather than the outcome When you choose a path like animation which may not align with traditional expectations its vital to remember this principle Your duty dharma is to express your creativity and passion through animation to bring stories to life and to connect with others through your art The value of your work does not lie solely in its reception or the recognition it receives but in the sincerity love and effort you put into it  Animation is an incredible field blending art storytelling and technology Its a medium that has the power to inspire educate and entertain touching lives in ways that few other fields can Your interest in animation as a career is not just a pursuit of a job but a calling to contribute to this creative legacy  Remember every field including science has its pioneers who were once discouraged from following their dreams Yet its their perseverance and dedication to their passion that led to their success and in many cases changed the world  So keep your head high Your journey might be challenging at times but its yours to make and it can be incredibly rewarding Your passion and skills in animation can create worlds tell stories that matter and bring joy to many<new>Please tell your parents that your aunt slapped you and then never speak to her again<new>\\u201cHaathi chale apni chaal aur kuttey bhokte rahe hazar\\u201d  Who cares what people think Screw them this is your life So live it  If you want to become an animator become one Remember you only live once and life is too short to care about petty opinions You are your own person and don\\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise If you live to please others especially the hostile ones then you\\u2019ll do a disservice to yourself There\\u2019s only one person who will stick with you throughout your life and that person is you So be you and make yourself proud<new>Those idiots dont know anything Only IT jobs and foreign That too they only know companies like TCS Infosys etc You mention any other company they think you are having an average job lol<new>Ok theres nothing wrong being a animator Dont let people tell you what you can or cant be follow your goals<new>The last thing you wanna

angry to see some women who are liberated but dont give attention  Preexisting male dominated society teach young men to see women as objects Men chasing women is normalized but the rejection of women is not Its this mix of selfesteem issues sexual frustration and unfair expectations of servitude from women that encourages violence against women  On top of that we blame the woman There are thousands of people who commented on various social media that why does this girl have to go camp in a remote village like its her fault  To add insult to injury there is no provision to teach sex education which includes the topic of consent to the masses  These men are the product of our society We cannot ignore anymore that everything is great about our culture and carry insecurity and fake pride  httpspreviewredditx1f15x93pbmc1jpegwidth1080formatpjpgautowebps440788bdb9519372ae88cba11748d83614c6a46f<new>Where can you even get a however out of this  The only one I can think of is however

some of the comments here are downplaying the incident  shifting the blame to women for how they raised the men its fucking nuts<new>Can I be the harsh truth bearer  India\\u2019s image is not that good when it comes to this regard if someone truly loves India and wants it to prosper they need to admit it has some real wrong stuff happening and try to fix them  Recognizing the problem is the first step to solve it<new>Its the Indian mentality that Ghar ki buri baat bahar nahi nikalni chahiye We dont admit mistakes so scope for the situation to be better<new>The world is already very aware of the problem<new>All these people worried about image are essentially a repacked version of the age old log Kya kahenge and samaaj mein naak kat jayega so keep quiet but at a global level vs a societal level l  Whatever  is the reality of a  country needs to be accepted  Women ARE NOT safe in most of NORTH INDIA Its a regressive backward society out there with UP Bihar and Haryana deserving special mention  South is RELATIVELY better for women<new>One Piece truth bombs right there<new>It is your image whether you agree to it or not  The only way out of it is to fix Indias attitude toward sexual assault but India is clearly a country that doesnt care when women are raped<new>India has a shit image anyways anyone who says otherwise has never stepped foot outside of India  Edit and the worst part is that BJPs propaganda machine has convinced every right winger that they are already superior than anyone else people have made Modi into some Messiah against whom they will not hear a single complaint cause that in their eyes is tantamount to insulting their god they are busy demonizing an entire group of people they have never had any direct interaction with and the rich will keep getting richer and more powerful while all these suckers have the wool pulled over their eyes I once had hope for India in the 90 and early 2000s now sadly I will never see my country prosper in my lifetime<new>No image left honestly stories like these weekly<new>Spot on Speaking as a non Indian the world is very very aware of Indians problem in this area The only way it could lose more face is by denying the problem exists like the people you argue against   I actually felt quite a bit of admiration when I saw how many upvotes this post had as it showed how people were willing to acknowledge the problem on a sub Ie a sub about a country which are traditionally filled with nationlists<new>Thats a strong comment Damn<new>Sorry but indias image is basicly good food scammers harrassment rape and corpses in the streets  I guess bollywood and shitty politics for people that are interested in either<new>Well said Fujitora<new>Also what image is there to loose In my country most people already know that india is one of the worst countries to travel in for women<new>Well said bhaiya \\ud83d\\ude4f<new>Isso moment<new>Nah using a One Piece quote for this is crazy but correct \\ud83d\\udc80<new>So sickening that the log kya kahenge mentality has percolated into our psyches to such an extent Lets not call out our people because what will other countries think of us  operates on the same level as lets not call out our family members because what will our surrounding neighbours people will think of us<new>Onepiece<new>I love how indians people think any people outside of India have a good image of this country I swear we dont I can only speak for France though  And in Canada its only going downhill as well<new>If a woman is raped and someones first thought is the image of the country that is whats wrong with the country<new>admitting fault and Supporting her for the Justice is a Good thing what i find vile is the degree of manipulating the news regarding the recent horrific incident A girl with  slatzism on sharing tweet with a quote like they were resting at a tourist market in Dumka like really People like manipulating to such extend that it seems Horrific incident happen in the hustle and bustle of the market and no one support them like really  even we as an indian forbid going to certain place even during the day let know camping right in the middle of dangerous forest at night<new>Foreigner here its all bit late for anyone to worry about Indias image Ninety percent of the time your country comes up in my news feed its to report the latest gang rape incident<new>  Indias image  this IS Indias image This is what India is<new>I know Im gonna be heavily downvoted I have western friends A few of their friends were shot dead in Brazilgang war as I have heard I met a Georgian guythe country near Russia who cycled his way from Georgia through Afghanistan Iran Pakistan and then India He was beaten down badly in an attempt to rob him He was safe only cuz he is athletic and has physical strength Nothing of any similar sort happened in India I know western women who come to India regularly and stay at places which are relatively safe according to them They cycle till late at night and even have late night walks without anything happening to themexcept for a few people trying to scam Among them I know 5 Italian women who were in India during covid first struck The Italian government arranged transportation for them to go home but they preferred not to cuz they felt safer heretheir words not mine You can say its a lie but I can literally name the places where you can see lots of cases like itnot here cuz I find those places peaceful and I dont want people rushing and visiting them My girlfriend is from the north east but she never felt like India is a unsafe country she was a bit scared during Manipur riots peak time   Reason for me telling this I asked my foreigner friends on what they think of India as in if they feel safe and all They said something which actually my girlfriend agreed to They said demons are everywhere in every part of the world It is not just an Indian thing Either they can stay in fear or live their life My Italian friend told me you have a high chance of getting shot at South Africa but does that mean majority of the people support it nope But how many times have you seen such articles on shooting and such about that country come up in newspapers I hope I made my point clear<new>I can assure you as an American India does not And they may think Israel and America loves that India is doing the same to their Muslim minority populations but in reality they both even despise that The only thing India has that is worthwhile to anyone globally is labor and cash No one is thinking that it is even close to being a modern nation Lots of work to do Lots My sister married an academic and lives in Delhi the stories she shares as she has been to every state in India Much beauty but much depravity<new>I see this on a recurring basis where people are offended when a \\u201cnegative\\u201d picture is presented \\u201cOh it only happens in so and so place\\u201d \\u201cOh as if xyz country is perfect\\u201d stfu and take responsibility for what\\u2019s wrong Unless someone is spreading fake news anything happening within the borders is something

even think its possible I remember seeing a photo of the one of the 2012 rapists walking to court or something and was shocked to see how well looked after he seemed This was many years later too I dont want a prisoner for the one of the most vile crimes looking like hes living the good life Compare that to the news of the female prisoners ending up with kids it seems like prisons are being run by other rapists or rape apologists or the like Add to that how slow our processes are justice is non existent<new> them to set an example  How many examples need to be set for gangrapes to stop though<new>Nah will get bail in no time indian joosticcee<new>you forgot thishttpsmedia1tenorcommcoMsDIkgwcgAAAACpadmegif<new>And thats why your country is shit and things like this happen all the

out well was only a mere chance of luck nothing else<new>Did not see a comment like that but i do agree that islamic countries are alooot more dangerous for a western girl  Thats for sure<new>they camped with Taliban<new>Give a fuck about a \\u201csense of belonging\\u201d if i have to be constantly worried about being raped<new>Youre right The sad truth is my parents are here too and being a first generation immigrant in another country is no cake walk  Theres a difference between going somewhere as a tourist vs actually being accepted by the local people there  So because of these reasons Ill also stay in India But Ill keep my head down earn as much as I can and live my life peacefully Thats pretty much all we can do here <new>Really tough to read Im sorry for all your troubles and pains and BS glad you got to experience of safety with your friend in germany  Def something we take for granted here in US<new>People like Ambani are the problem All the wealth is hoarded by a few while the rest of the population lives in poverty No education or chances in life means more babies which makes the overpopulation problem worse If Indian rich people and leaders wouldnt be so greedy and selfish then India wouldnt have these problems All of Asia has no culture going against capitalism and thats whats keeping all these countries down<new>Was Nirbhaya the bus attack where they drove to the middle of nowhere beat her male companion unconscious and assaulted that poor woman with bottles and metal pipes and shit like that<new>I wish the women in your country could leave safely and go somewhere where they can finally feel safe and at peace You matter and your skills and personality can and will be greatly appreciated somewhere else Indian women are one of the funniest and softest kind Ive encountered and I feel so sad whenever I see horrible news from a country that is so far behind<new>Nothing we do will fix that alr just take the hope from all victims and hate on a country and all of its people Lets just give up and live in a hllhole I dont understand why people are blaming all of us I do feel bad for the woman but leftists saying we all are to blame is crazy Yeah I am a minor studying going to school respects women and it is totally my fault as well<new>Just leave and take the chance from the people who actually want to develop Dont come back after I have friends who are girls who are safe taking one case and generalising is just ignorant and dumb Giving up isnt even a solution you have to work for it Do you think Germany was always like this Poverty eradication made them developed<new>Its not safe and its dirty I think the most unappealing things for us europeans is the squallor and the trash everywhere  But in the end your issue is not the image is political you have shitty politicians and a shitty government If you had better politicians things would run better<new>removed<new>\\u201cNobody wants to visit\\u201d  India had 15 million foreign

was outnumbered 31 I wouldnt have left that girl with those guys without a fight<new>deleted<new>Bro u left girl to be slapped around possibly worse Call the police next time We have most non corrupt police in world<new>The corrupt politicians arent organizing the gangs of normal people going around raping folks<new>Which stupid rules are you referring to in this context<new>And Hindus\\u00a0<new>That case of the 30 something married indian dude who branded his preteen sister to death because he didnt know what periods were and thought she had an affair when she couldnt explain why she was bleeding<new>I totally agree with you on the first para Like there really needs to proper sex education in all age group tbh  However on the second paragraph I may not share the opinion Cause one there literally isnt any fear the culprit still thinks they can get away with a call from local MLA they do the death penalty for one is hardly there There is like one hanged in 4 years for rape and all due to it being a highly covered case  So there just isnt fear I say fast track the case more and give out more death penalty Fear needs to be there Ofcourse this isnt a solution we need proper education and social awareness but I still say a good amount of fear should be there<new>I think the issue is misogyny rather than sexual repression in Indian men If anything they view women as sex objects especially foreigners and have zero empathy or respect for women let alone see them as an individual with valuable thoughts and feelings   Especially the second paragraph I disagree  lock all of them up and put attention on actually doing something and they will fall in line That behavior is unacceptable  and still gets even tolerated in first world countries because misogyny holds a deep grip everywhere<new>Isnt the main problem poverty and lack of education which leads to sexual repression There are vast socioeconomic differences within the country<new>Well lets try killing as many rapists as we want first and then see<new>umm also didnt you forget about the gender ratio Since nobody seems to want a girl child<new>I completely disagree here in most Islamic countries its the same as india sexual feelings and romantic relationships before marriage is not accepted yet they are very normal around girls and respect them I think there is an underlying problem in india that causes this and it needs to be addressed<new>Its not sexual repression its the patriarchal misogynistic upbringing When you grow in an environment where women are seen as objects you will treat them like it Parenting should change But unfortunately it wont Its all in the environment you are brought up in   Gay men bisexual men and women lesbian women and straight women are sexually repressed too but it is only straight men who usually rape So it is definitely not about sexual repression they do it to show they can thats it<new>Id say the core issue is the lack of severe punishments in cases like these no matter who the criminal knows   But I get your point too<new>Interesting Hey can you please give an example where such sexual repression is not there any country culture or anything<new>You cant blame the education system for rape raping someone is a mental issue not a societal issue<new>No non veg or women will get impure thoughts Ive heard that logic from aunties before This country is massively retarded<new>Peeche<new>Like in pretty much any other country itd be impossible to get seven men whod agree to stalk and rape a girl without a single one of them going to police to turn the rest in Obviously every nation has more rapists than that but being able to just gather that many among your friends or nearby strangers is just almost unthinkable   If my life depended on it I dont think I could go out and find six other men whod agree to rape someone today  Im not trying to shame Indian men cause I know most of you guys would never do this I just hope womens safety improves<new>Karolina Goswami   That women from that dEtAilS channel should watch Ravish Kumar at some point to know about actually shenanigans I wonder if she talked about Manipur  Wrestlers  BB last years but i doubt<new>Be proud to be an Indian woman  It is the men who should be ashamed<new>it\\u2019s a slap also to the Indian diaspora overseas who try too hard to create a better image for our India  Honestly I dont Except for food I gave up Its moreso when you think it cant get worse Im proved wrong This case is just a drop in ocean Agreed she being a foreigner case is getting traction But what about the women in my life Do their life have no value   Spending a fortune on Mandirs and masjids is more important than the well being of the subjects

              "' bad  Noding head means acknowledging   Indian culture don’t have a thing to say thank you as often as in west When you are serving them they see it’s your job and for all practical purposes there no need to saying thanks This doesn’t mean that they disrespect you I say thank you every time I interact with a service employee but that’s a learned skill  Not flushing toilets is not an Indian thing they might just have forgotten Not an excuse but that could have happened    About wet toilets The toilets in India are wet same in Vietnam So a dry toilet is not a thing wet toilet doesn’t mean a dirty toilet in Indian culture I hate wet toilets but I can image why this is not a big deal with them  About compliance of rule they are just dick heads for not following it They will push the boundaries of rules just to test how mush they can get away with Absolute shits<new>Why are you expecting everybody to thank you for just doing your job You get paid for servicing the customers and they have already paid for the tickets and the service that you provide I always say please and thank you to anybody and everybody but you expecting people to thank you for just doing your job is ridiculous and seriously entitled IMO<new>you get paid to deal with people If youre struggling please resign<new>removed<new>removed<new>removed<new>Please and thank you for us are words which arent said frequently They are spoken only when we really mean it English speakers say these words just like that For every little things i have seen native speakers say please and thank you This completely ruins the depth of these words for Indians   You are a Flight Attendent and it is your job to service passengers Expecting them to say please and thank you to you is a native speaker expectation from you but not a necessity You can have an opinion that this is rude but it isnt a factual statement and i would highly disagree with you Imagine being called rude for minding my own business and asking for service which I paid for Flight attendant judging me cuz i didnt say please and thank you is a kind of snowflake i would not like to have too as an attendant in the first place   Is it a cultural think to be a snowflake in native english speaker Maybe not but majority are and i am tired of them<new>Karma farming Downvoting this Clearly the OP is an Indian<new>removed<new>I think OPs rant is a little racist though<new>Whole country is like this Kids aren’t taught basic manners and etiquette in school or by their parents<new>You forgot to add some to your title and if you are doing your job for thank yous and peace of mind no job gives you that  Youve got to yearn it to earn it<new>removed<new>I have no input on the Indians on airplanes being rude but I operate a dry cleaners in America and they are also by far the rudest most entitled customers I have as well They fight with me on all the prices and tell me how cheap things are in India like that has any bearing on my prices They bring in the most trashed items and if they don’t turn out perfect like brand new they demand I replace their 10 year old worn out shit with a brand new piece of clothing Like what And just last night I had an Indian guy call 3 minutes before close and demand not ask that I stay open late because he hasn’t left work yet and wanted to pick up some items And when I told him no he told me I needed to deliver to him across town…i could go on for days I love all my customers for the most part but I’m getting to the point where I have to take a deep breath every time and Indian person walks in<new>They feel entitled because they paid<new>Im sorry for everything you endured and this is not a justification of those anyway but yes it is cultural We carry the 5000 year old baggage of the caste system and centuries of colonial rule   Perceptions of social hierarchy are a bit messed up here and the arrogance stems from that I hope more of us will actively try to relearn in the near future and I hope within two or three generations itll be a lot better Apologies for your inconvenience again  As for the not flushing part I dont know Thats really gross And theres no explanation as to why But is that THAT frequent I always thought it to be an aberration   And dont worry about the headwobbling its just something we do subconsciously it isnt intended to be rude actually it may be an expression of gratitude at times  And for your convenience the next time heres a guide if you want to know otherwise you can simply say that you do not understand and ask them to say it to you in words   ↕️  YES    ↗️  AGREEING WITH YOU   🔄  LISTENING TO YOU WITH ATTENTION    ↔️  NO   ⬇️  AGREEING   OR ITS THE CLASSIC HEAD BOW an expression of GRATITUDE ANDOR RESPECT  These are the most common ones If the patterns repeat intensely it often means a great intensity of the same response   ⏩ The head bow is never repeated Its often a gentle and gracious one time bow<new>Omg spare me I bet you are Indian yourself do know what the head bobble means and made this post to entertain yourselfexpress your internalized racism\\xa0 If you arent Indian shut up Focus on your own groups problems Maybe ask your supervisor for guidance on reframing your racist attitude\\xa0<new>Its common sense that it isnt a cultural thing  Its a selective group of rich entitled people Trust me these redditors commenting it stems from culture are the ones you are actually talking about lol<new>I am curious as well I am an Indian I am very conscious of my behavior in USA as this reflects the behavior of my countrymen Just a thought I think India should have very stringent policy when it comes to unruly passenger Sometimes I think the fear of getting finedjailedbanned might work We are not ready yet to enjoy the fruits of comfortable life<new>The entire world is rude Not just Indians Explore more<new>Id say more cranky than rude  1 Long lines at airport and all the procedures are too tiresome 2 Uncomfortable flight seats 3 Shitty food given as if it is gold  Air travel is costly and people are treated like shit<new>It goes both ways  air hostess and land crew are rude and racist  to specifically Indians  especially middle east airlines  You get treated as you treat others  Not excusing behavior of assholes  but just pointing out there are assholes on both sides<new>This is bait post by new account<new>Why is sky blue<new>They are trying to take revenge for colonialism by being an asshat I swear it be like that<new>Well not all Indian passengers would be like that but agree with the general sentiment Indians really are one of the worst travellers on flights and it actually has gotten worse over the years Unfortunately most Indians still believe that flights are an expansive deal and hence considering they have paid substantial money for the tickets are free to do as they please Domestic flights are even worse with people not paying heed to deboarding announcements talking loudly playing music with speakers on and not having control of their kids<new>I have seen flight attendants ignore Indians who are decent and civilized and I don’t go about making a post or stereotyping all flight attendants<new>Im dont want this to sound racist but    proceeds to puke up racist tripe<new>Its like saying every white person is racist or any other stereotype associated with any race or nationality Lets not lose heads and ask question in Na manner that is logical<new>I must disagree because there is clear racism towards South East Asian passengers specifically directed towards Indians passengers on certain Middle Eastern Airlines such as QA EI and KW The prejudice begins with the selection of flights and continues through the inflight service The discrimination against passengers with brown skin is not disguised but rather openly displayed<new>removed<new>This is actually a twoway street I have had to deal with extremely racist airline staff in UK and France when flying in or out Treats asian people especially brown skinned folks like less than human entities I dont want to go into specifics but I have had enough instances of this to comment that it wasnt one or two individuals who had this issue with me   While I agree that some Indians have an issue with compliance which may stem from lack of education upbringing or social cues like lack of dignity of labour for certain jobs we should also be mindful of the fact that some Europeans and Americans are extremely biased and have an unfounded superiority complex towards people from the Indian subcontinent   And since the only person whom we can change at the end of the day is us Im sure that the OP would check for subconscious racial biases and I would make an honest effort to be as socially pleasing as I can<new>I think you should leave your job youre pathetic<new>To all the commenters down in the post saying Lack of civic sense and flying etiquettes etc etc I have one question a genuine one who TF gives a class on these Are Indians supposed to be born with this You all are actually too entitled   OP the bathroom thing is actually gross and thats actually gross but in no way will I believe that the majority do that Except that grow up and learn to accept other cultures as well the world doesnt revolve around your culture only and they have paid for the flight and everything else out of their own pockets they are not required to get accustomed to your culture they are not required to say thank you or please if they are not accustomed to these things in their own world Yes we got that youre working in a North American airline grow up dude You might be doing a lot of work but youre not really doing it out of your own goodwill but for money Respect it and move on<new>Youre from London or USA <new>  No it’s not all Indians but it’s a majority of them when they fly   OPs either trolling or a racist Saying its a large number of Indians is understandable as Indians are one of the biggest ethnic immigrant groups in the States But majority indicates she thinks 51 or more Indians behave this way which is simply categorically false Only a prejudiced bigot would say something like that<new>Actually theyre all Pakistanis pretending to be Indians to bring bad name to Indians<new>Indian mentality is just bad the lower educated class cant give 2 shits about following whatever laws you put in place They think its your job to suck it up an deal with it Lot of cope here to protect this bad attitude lol  Its not a you problem<new>Not all of us But yes there are few ones who give the rest of us a bad name<new>Apart from the head bobble none of it is racist Its a cultural thing among South Asians<new>It’s a combination of factors   There is a general expectation in India of people performing their duties without being thanked for It’s not necessarily a sign of disrespect but most Indians won’t feel the need to explicitly thank others for doing what they signed up for   For a lot of Indians air travel specially internationally is a new thing and their expectations on how to behave might be different to other cultures or nationalities Japanese now their heads in respect but Europeans don’t but that does not mean Europeans less grateful than Japanese  There are rude people everywhere including India who feel entitled and show in their behavior and manners  For new travelers or people who don’t travel so often they might be nervous and don’t behave how one might expect from a seasoned traveler<new>A few days back there was a post on this same sub where a person was complaining why train’s washroom are not clean in India I gave tge same answer to him Its not the cleaner its us who have to maintain the washroom clean<new>NOW WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARGUED IN A RECENT POST THAT ITS OK TO NOT SAY THANKYOU AND PLEASE WHEN I COMMENTED THAT THESE ARE BASIC MANNERS You people are responsible for this reputation non indians have of us<new>It’s not always the case But there’s a general entitlement and lack of basic manners culture among rich Indians Especially those who haven’t been exposed to other cultures<new>Wait until you see a fist fight mid air lol<new>The one answer to most questions on this sub population population population<new>Man I must be living in a different dimension I travel numerous times for work especially to India I live in US But I have not had a bad experience or anything other than what would be deemed normal ever Few outliers here and there but this post makes it seem it’s like travelling nightmare every time<new>They havent developed the sophistication of the west Ive observed this everywhere Very few people know what gratitude is  very few people know what boundaries are just a bunch of unsophisticated animals<new>Blud you cant make this shi up  being an asshole isnt a national thing 😭😂<new>I have a different perspective here I’ve travelled quite a bit and work in sales internationally and I had to put an effort to learn the mannerisms I work in sales and hence I need to learn I don’t think others will put that effort Some of the people you encounter as rude are not actually rude it is just a language thing   Most of us are not native English speakers and our English is just our mother tongue translated to English   You approach an Indian for something heshe may say “tell me” No please nothing else Just “tell me” This is considered polite and acceptable in India but not outside I had to learn to say “ how may I help you “ instead of “tell me” The problem is in our language we can say tell me with respect and without respect  just like vouz and tu for French English doesn’t allow that When I speak in India I use “tell me” instead of “how may I help you” because in every day life that will be weird in India  Since in Indian languages we have variations for request being polite we typically don’t use “please” and we miss it in most of our requests as our requests are just translations   In short I’ll say most Indians are rude without them knowing  My personal experience  After my GMAT I’ve applied to a premier institution in the US for my post graduation The institute has a policy of calling the applicants and communicating that the admission is confirmed before sending the official acceptance letter I got the call the other line said “Am I speaking with Mr X” I’ve said “Yes tell me”… There was a looong pause she just mentioned that my application is accepted and I’ll get a welcome kit with acceptance letter soon and cut the call<new>Genuine question is there a Hindi word for please Never heard it or learned it in my travels<new>and after the airplane takes off they all get up and stand in the aisleways for hoursits a cultural thing<new>False sense of entitlement<new>Hehe what you experienced is just a trailer of india Travel by train and you will see a complete Directors cut with Deleted Scenes 🍿<new>Are you talking about international flights or domestic Indian flights A lot of international flights might have first time international travellers or hell even first time ever and to them its like they paid such a huge amount of money they feel really entitled Its a cultural thing for the majority of India when theyve paid for something they put everything aside Its unfortunate That being said it is surely a sweeping generalization because well were 15 billion and you surely havent met all of us  Im Indian and always comply with rules never stand up while the plan is still taxiing after landing in Indias domestic flights youll have half the plane stand up ready to deboard as soon as touchdown we call it premature evacuation and always say thank you and welcome But then again I had a relatively middle class upbringing where I was never raised entitled enough to be demeaning to service workers Will I want to make most of the service Ive paid Yes I will But for me that does not mean that I have the right to mistreat the people providing the service   India is also cutthroat competitive where how much you make often dictates how much respect you get Its often ingrained inside us while growing up that if you dont study enough youll end up a waiter or a construction worker both jobs may afford you a lower middle classmiddle class life in the US but in India youd be easily poor<new>Why do the airlines tolerate them<new>Old habits and worries anxieties etc from UK colonialism die hard<new>Have a friend whose mother works as a stewardess She said that Indians are the worst passengers and that turn the inside of planes into shitholes<new>I feel weird saying thank you and so do most of the people i know And I don’t think it’s rude and neither the people I interact with think it’s rude that I didn’t say thank you for a minor thing like bringing me a bottle of water or bringing me my food 🤷\\u200d♂️ But I have experienced people getting awkward when i do say thank you for something the other person did that’s their job Ig it’s just an indian thing 🤷\\u200d♂️ And clearly THANK YOU is a western thing  and 99 of our conversations happen in our native languages and i have rarely heard anyone say thank you in their native language to some waiter or shopkeeper 🤷\\u200d♂️ I’m not trying to justify anything just sharing my personal experience<new>Why do people not say please and thank you to me while doing my damn job No one is entitled to coddle you for doing the bare minimum And that snide you’re welcome isn’t helping your case here Y’all are also very disrespectful of Indian people and if you can’t do a service job leave No one is making you<new>Your observations are mostly correct Obviously it is hard to break this cycle Sometimes there will be cases where the crew is prejudiced and misbehaves with Indian passengers On some of the international flights I have seen the crew literally treat Indian passengers as young kids in school<new>How many Indians have you seen Whats your sample size You are making broad stroke comments some of which are offensive And since when did putting small items in the overhead cabin become such a big deal  But I agree with you on the first few points though Treating the people providing servicehospitality with respect is something that we need to improve<new>The problem with Indians not saying please thank you or you’re welcome is that it’s not a part of our spoken language In our culture one is expected to do their work Honestly speaking in spoken Indian languages these terms aren’t there at all It’s a cultural thing And saying thank you or please or sorry is a very official way I think you have experienced the creamy layer The rich and upper middle class The ones who are exposed to western culture often mix English words with local languages I’ve faced this issue when I started my career and I had to learn to use these terms and to say things like how’s the weather etc so that our clients don’t think I’m rude<new>You’re not being racist it’s a genuine observation and question No it’s not cultural thing I think Indians can be overly polite 90 of the time but there’s something weird about traveling in the last 10 years I think they go batshitcrazy It’s also a little bit of “if they can get away with this I need to too” BUT it also works the other way around I’ve flown on flights directly to India where the stewardesses were extremely rude almost racist Like I was in business class in my 30s once and at first they wouldn’t let me through until I had to scream at them that I’m in business class Jumbo plane so I had to walk up for biz class and I rudely told to go to my seat upstairs is not for me until I flashed my tkt at the stewardesses faces I’ve seen them being rude to people who just can’t understand them language barrier once I had to curtly remind a couple they are on a flight to India when they were shittalking and being exasperated by an old Indian couple I’ve seen one grab a lady’s arm screaming at her she can’t go across the middle aisle people are sitting there when it turned out to be her own kids The lady tersely told her to not touch her and she can hear her loud and clear without her yelling which totally surprised the Stewardess So it can really go both ways but I do think generally there’s this crazy pandemonium on flights to and from India so I try to avoid those type of routes I haven’t seen any particular behavior from handful of people in a flight though and i travel a lot<new>India is a big country with many different languages Also expecting people to communicate comfortably in your language is you taking something basic for granted I blame it on our school system which is not based on empathy but more like a military system Anyways We might find it difficult to say thank you but will help you when you need it<new>Really sorry you had to experience that Depends on the upbringing tbh Im fully Indian and I always smile and thank the flight attendants because they have one of the hardest most demanding jobs and its every passengers duty to make their stressful lives a bit better its the bare minimum I surround myself with the kind of people who would do the same  Also I agree most Indians outside their homes have a HUGE lack of hygiene But they will call you racist and prejudiced if you say that to them We have a serious problem with taking criticism and indulge a lot in whataboutism to counteract criticisms   Even my maternal uncle who works in the hospitality industry has seen an abysmally embarrassing amount of Indians interrupt his employees in the middle of their work and hounding them with excuse me while theyre clearly busy as opposed to waiting for a few extra seconds  India really needs to work on this I feel genuine second hand embarrassment hearing these stories in real life and online  The head nods are a very South Asian trait It can yes and no But I and most use it as a yes So I guess thats how you should take it as that ┐\\u2060\\u2060\\xa0\\u2060∵\\u2060\\xa0\\u2060\\u2060┌<new>Everything is correct BUT  I dont understand the rule of small items underneath the seat So a passenger who brings small item is penalized with lesser leg space while others who have brought luggage bigger than the size limit most airlines do not check get to enjoy  I once had a small backpack placed overhead Another lady came with a big size trolley The air hostess simply removed my backpack and after asking whose bag it is says please keep this down there I questioned saying the same thing above So I brought a smaller item and so I should be penalised and get less legroom She said sorry and then tried to make space overhead and fitted the trolley  my backpack above<new>The please in our language is mostly expressed in the form of how we address people Aappolite  respectful vs Tu informal  In English it would be the choice of Kind Sir vs You when addressing a person   The word Please is used very easily in English Its usage doesnt imply any favour being rendered It only refers to politeness   In local Indian languages Please refers to asking someone for a favour for which you will be indebted towards It carries a higher weight in society It is equal to asking someone Could you do me a favour in English<new>Now I don’t know if this explains everything but this should at least explain the head bobble  We have maids and drivers whom we interact with daily We tend to just nod when they ask or say anythingIt is somewhat standard for Indians to treat people working for them as an inferior since they depend on us The intent of the behaviour may or may not be malicious but the outcome is always hurtful and sometimes downright humiliating   Also many Indians especially men think they know better than an airhostess because she is technically a maid It’s a social issue<new>Again I hope this doesn’t come by as racist but it’s just simply an observation  Indians are not a race<new>There are a billion plus Indians on earth and a few hundred million of them behaving badly create bad stereotype for the whole of indians<new>So I am white married to an Indian In his language politeness is expressed though what you call someone and how you change the verb structure it’s sort of like how in French there is a formal “vous” and informal “tu” for “you” No one ever says “please” or “thank you” they say “give me that” “take this” “eat” etc But it’s not in a rude sense there’s just no equivalent word And I’ve been told that I sound very “posh” when I do use “please” “thank you” etc The head bobble is acknowledgmentthanks   Also not everyone learns a foreign languagemannerisms easily  As for the rest of your post there are always people who lack common sense and common courtesy There is a huge spectrum of mannerisms I’ve seen in India from very gentlemanlyladylike to extremely obtuse It is a highly populated country and I see more competition amongst each other than courtesy for each other here in general  Edit Also Indian cleanliness involves using water after using the toilet If you don’t use water after going 2 then your bumhole is “unholy” But it does get messy As a westerner I also get frustrated with wet toilet seatsfloors even though I understand Don’t know why the toilet wouldn’t be flushed though<new>I understand that it is your experience And I feel sorry that you had to go through it  That being said the gross generalization and putting a disclaimer at the end saying that youre not generalizing is very Karen like  Just as you dont understand the head bobble they dont understand the youre welcome The idea about what is rude and whats not is very culture specific and I can guarantee if you visit a middle class semi urban household in india youll be considered extremely rude for demanding your own mentalphysical space  Im not justifying any of the incidents but criticizing the way youve put it across That is very rude VERY rude<new>Class system where people think they are born better than anyone not in their classtheir dharma and karma made them Brahmin<new>Had rude Indian couple behind me force the flight attendant to unrecline my seat so their fantasies can have more room I was about to eat anyways but that pissed me off They also started shouting at the flight attendant for no reason<new>Kyuki Indians sochte Hainagar Paisa Diya hain to kuch bhi bol sakte hai<new>i was travelling on an air vistara flight last Saturday and a junior air hostess accidentally rubbed a lady with her food trolley thing during the flight That lady was behind my seat and she started yelling at the air hostess The air hostess calmly told she was announcing her approach anyways before passing through Then one boomer guy apparently that lady’s relative joined this conversation and started abusing the air hostess rightaway stating that she was too rude and her reply was not even polite He threatened her that he would start recording her and would complain once the flight landed The poor air hostess was in tears at this point and left the scene to avoid further escalations That same boomer guy later on demanded to remove his finished snack juice bottle before the air hostess started for clearing as he is not easy with holding the waste and the air hostess had to take them with a smile\\xa0 Honestly I believe some rich boomers are raised to think with a mentality that they can boss around anyone who is in a financially lower status than them They are unnecessarily rude and have no remorse or whatsoever on their actions\\xa0<new>I’d like to hear the views of someone working in one of the domestic airlines in India on this post   I can’t relate to what you have posted around being rude cleanliness etc in fact I don’t agree with your views  But I agree with respect to compliance Indians do tend to be one of the last to be seated and sometimes get up even with the seatbelt sign on I don’t do this but I admit  as soon as I hear one person unbuckle their seatbelt and we feel the urge to do it and stand up too<new>Youve got plenty of replies on this by now But it is also a topic of interest to me some from my own experiences and some from observations and some from mere hearsay There may be more than one reason for each of your observations  Assuming you are genuinely interested in why and not how to fix it because lets face it thats gonna happen in this generation sorry   Saying thank you and please This is just not part of Indian culture If you come across one that is an outcome of exposure and nothing else The ones saying these words may have been taught about this in the media working with westerners traveling etc while it is the right thing to do just dont expect it it is a massive undertaking to teach 14B people to say please and thank you the second way to look at this is propaganda growing up in popular Indian media it was shown like a bad thing to say thank you and please I recall someone saying Oh the British left India with that  saying please thank you and sorry do whatever you want and then drop these words and that just washes your sins away People would commit a fault which they could have easily avoided and then say a sorry in the end and walk away like they did not even feel it it was infuriating really disrespectful behavior so yeah the word sorry has turned sour here and the third way which is an important one is how an Indian sees someone working in the service industry to us a maid is the same as a server at a restaurantcheckout assistant at a grocery storea car driveran electrician and a flight attendant look at these workers like they are totally beneath you and they are there just to serve you like the other software you mentioned you have access to for checking every passengers citizenshipvisa etc if only you had a software to see what actually was brewing inside an Indians brain this is probably what you would uncover and this is probably why even if the passenger knows about saying thank you and please the thought in their head is oh but this person I dont need to say those words it is their duty to serve and take care of me I paid a lot of money for this so better keep me happy or else imma yell at you like i shout at my bai so the best outcome here is not someone actually saying those words the faster you lose hope on that the better but simply respecting you and treating you like their own   lack of compliance this is a topic in itself and this is not limited just to rules about carryon bags in an airline this behavior is rampant everywhere  roads queues when traveling in public transit at a movie hall or a large gathering in the classroom at work We just dont like to comply to rules I have no idea why only when there are consequences penalty fines jail time do we fall in line and this is for the ones who actually can read rules and listen to instructions in your flight though half of them are probably not even following what you are saying to them its like background noise one can say not knowing the accent in which a westerner speaks could be the cause here but that cant be everyone to some others it relates to what I said above why do I care to listen to this maid whatever shes saying its sad just saw on the telly about that door plug incident on the Alaska Airlines kid got saved because of the seat belt safety is very important and listen to the flight attendant like it is your first time on the flying machine every single time because you never know which one is going to be your last one   washrooms I tend to agree with the observation made here two reasons I can think of one Indians use water extensively when we go to the loo TP is very uncommon here maybe some star hotels have it but most of them have running water to cleanup whatever it is that you intend to clean so not realizing it is the flight toilet and not the one from your home lack of civic sense one wants to splash water all over the face maybe on the chest too while you are at it leaving a mess behind we forget these toilets are meant to be left as dry as it was before you walked in Oh hello it wasnt made tidy just for you we need to do the bare minimum to do your deed and cleanup after yourself you can get that top tier full service car wash when you go home The second reason is and I keep coming back to this one over and over again how you look at it your view of the object toilet is a dirty place to do the dirty deed thats what we Indians have in our minds so whats dirty deserves to be dirty So even if someone put the effort to clean it and make it sparkle let me go and create a mess It is very hard for us to accept even toilets kitchens bedrooms the street outside our homes is what we make of it if we want them to be RollsRoyce and if you are not British Cadillac then put the effort maintain and treat it like one but we dont and I dont see this changing anytime soon There is one point I want borrow here from what someone else said in their post this is a result of lowering the cost to be on an airline and bring on the common masses on board you just invited a very large population who have not been taught or exposed to such disciplined behaviors the outcome is not going to be good youre going to get mediocrity and that doesnt taste good   While the above are my opinions for why you may have seen these behaviors I cannot complete this wo saying this these days the behavior is mutual and it is getting worse day by day I may not be rich or have class but Im disciplined I respect everyone and behave this is very important to me But the way we Indians get treated on an airplane thanks to my fellow countrymen seriously fudge you behavior is not delightful at all Right from the stares I get when boarding to the look when being served the frustrated wrinkles on their faces when I call someone for a question or need help when Im boarding off even when I say thank you for your service and have a nice day I can actually sense that look of disapproval now that is attacking my dignity like what did I do to you Im brown and you hate me now because 10 others who look like me made your shift miserable go down that leftover Vodka I demand to be treated with respect Treat each and everyone like what they truly are an individual their personality is what they are made of and not their nationality skin color or language And one more thing Cindy Karens are White sowie I can never imagine a black Karen let alone other races Have a nice day<new>I think you’ve hit the nail on the head about the dignity of labour I’m IndoCanadian I’ve got to say that I have witnessed Indians behave really poor with service employees and I strongly believe it’s a class issue where service providers are seen beneath you   Random customer threatening to beat up a street vendor over accusations of being cheated Customer going up to the cook at the omelette counter at an upscale hotel and barking orders or a passenger being outright rude and impolite to flight attendants so much so that it makes me cringe when I’m next to them   The words please thank you excuse me sorry etc just seem to be missing from the Indian vocabulary<new>Saying Thank you please etc is not in Indian culture historically nor is the practice of it emphasised in schools or homes It is changing though at a snails pace Also Indians who can afford international travel always have domestic help at homes who do the cleaning and that is where the lack of cleanliness mentality comes from<new>Exceptionally articulated ⭐️<new>If you can tell me how to say please thank you you are welcome bon appétit have a good one in any Indian language I would accept all your comments To my knowledge the literal translations of these are almost never used in day to day conversations or maybe I just interact with inconsiderate assholes It is extremely weird to say kripaya dhanyavad unless in extremely formal situations Like when you are making announcements or maybe doing business transactions I dont know the translation of you are welcome and bon apétit is definitely not a thing The closest expression I know is eat slowly  which is usually used during ceremonial dinner not buffet but a pangat and the host goes to everyone to insist that they eat slowly  Personally I would almost exclusively communicate please and thank you through nonverbal methods in an Indian language In English I will say please thank you etc  Its a rather broad brush stroke to say that most of the Indians in flights are mannerless  they probably are but your answer completely ignores the cultural differences in how Indians express politeness and gratitude when they are not being assholes  As a side note I almost never receive a response when I say  thank you to a flight attendant on domestic flights in India 😂<new>deleted<new>Very good analysis sir thanks<new>This makes sense I’m not racist but when I have clients of indian decent sit down in my chair I am tense until they speak if they have an American accent I am much more relaxed I’ve been verbally abused by many clients of Indian decent and they were only the ones who had recently moved here I’m a hairstylist and they treat me like trash I had one man scream at me on Christmas Eve and make me cry he honestly ruined my holiday that year<new>Look we can rationalise our actions all we want but the truth stares at us in the face and it is NOT doing us any favours in keeping up our social image We make fools of ourselves and then wonder why we aren’t placed in the same league of treatment as other Asians or Europeans Why would we if this is the attitude There is an incredible amount of hubris and narcissism in Indians even toward others due to the power strata and that many Indians are simply raised in bad familial backgrounds and embody the same behaviours  I will accept that the previous generation was uneducated and uncultured and flight travel was a huge deal back then Our grandparents likely never even flew or understood that people serving them was just part of their duties and that they are also emergency staff But we can’t make excuses or cop outs any more Everyone has YouTube everyone has access to education atleast those that can fly and we have a responsibility to correct these behaviours It’s 2024 and people still carrying over colonialist mindsets thinking of themselves as the ever mighty customer is disgraceful  Dignity of labour is nothing but a respect toward others This is something that should be taught from a young age because children just emulate what they see their parents do I have seen enough and more parents actung like jerks not correcting their children cutting in line and not showing respect for others It’s all due to a lack of social accountability a social penalty and the chalta hai attitude where they know that no one will come after them<new>I think you are absolutely right However just to add dignity of labor is an end result or outcome not the root of the problem The root of the problem is untethered population growth You can launch 100 programs with good intent as long<sep>'"

priority should be to build good educational institutes and health care India has improved a lot in education since Independence but we still has a long way to go However Indias access to medical facilities especially in rural areas is lacking  Weve build Statue of unity  building Shivaji statue instead we couldve used that money to invest in nuclear solar  wind energy thereby reducing our dependence on oil from foreign entitiesI think Patel  Shivaji would have agreed on not been dependant on foreigners<new>That was not my point  I know I was not mocking you Its true that our brain’s capacity is almost fixed from birth The world is not all rainbow and sunshine There are also studies that shows that genetics play a huge role in intelligence So no matter how much you try to educate them the OP’s post will always be true unless you go for extreme eugenics So the only options are 1 Have a dictatorship and be fcked because its almost impossible to have a good dictator and even if you do theres no guarantee that the next one will be good 2 Have a broken democracy where idiot people rule this is the position were currently in And 3 Weigh peoples vote according to their thinking capacity and probably moral education as well and make it mandatory for political leaders to have some degree of educational background I didnt mention the last part in my comment here expanding there must be some kind of exam that would decide who our leaders will be<new>i saw this post literal minutes after it being posted its always been labeled as memessatire mfing armchair detectives get offended over nothing  the whole thing is just making fun of people by overexaggerating common stereotypes learn how to take a joke lmao<new>The 10 thing is bs but doesnt the population of 15 billion approximate the gaussian anyway due to the central limit theorem<new>You have a valid point here  The skewness can be on either side though considering that a large set of our population still lives in rural parts and has limited access to develop themselves<new>IQ is a normal distribution because it is literally DESIGNED to be a normal distribution Any good population level studies in India with a well designed IQ test will be a bell curve because that is how they give the distribution of the IQ scores Keep in mind that the actual intelligence level itself if there was ever a way to measure it has no need for it to be a normal distribution<new> half the population is always going to be below average  Of course  That is why what matters is where that Median line is It needs to be as far right as possible since that pushes the entire Distribution cohort right along with it  So it indeed matters how much intelligence increases by  Having 700 Million functional idiots is not the same as having 70 Million functional idiots This is not a linear relation as in more means nonlinear even higher than an exponential compounding mess mainly because its people in question not inanimate entities People are hard to predict hence more of them doesnt mean outcome will be Linear to the scale multiplier of that increase  This posts topic is considered Taboo subject in modern science due to legacy baggage it carries plus the hysterical dominance of a certain culture in Western Social Sciences which sets the agenda for places like India as well  There are 2 problems with this 1 if you dont research something and make it taboo the misinformation will take the space  2 these social scientists are hacks Actua science is already done just on the edges and by fewer people and its showing what was always known by human societies ie Humans are NOT born allequal some are just BETTER and more intelligent than others   This is an objective fact not subjective reality  Social scientists leverage the currently unknown ratiomix of NatureNurture to mean that basically everything is Nurture 100 While science is showing neither is 0 or 100  Like height heritablity is now very very well understood to have a NatureGenetic r value of 08 meaning if you are tall and have 10 kids the odds are 8 of you kids will also be similarly tall and 2 will not be  Intelligence is heritable but there is backforth whining  debate what the r value is some place it 01 some at 06 A good chunk place it near 04  Also even if one disagrees subjectively on IQ what is not in question is there being SOMETHING that is a proxy for IntelligenceCognitive Capacity It just gets new names every few decades Different types of IQ wasis in fad as well gfactor is another moniker that combines these things  The point remains the same there is indeed Something XYZ that is a proxy for measuring cognitive capacity  Then there are examples from multicultural ethnicities in developed OECD states where variables are Normalized like Nurture elements like parents income safety health nutrition education socialharmony etc etc  And we find there is INDEED racialethnic distribution as well East Asian for examples are very very gloaded in math This is not tiny this is a significant amount  And this will hold testing and research permitting in South Asia among Castes as well And one be sure how taboo this will be  We know for a fact that Poverty  Nutrition ie Nurture part of NatureNurture affects Physical attributes like height health of their descendants Well it would be farcical to assume that everything on the body is affect EXCEPT the brain that has no affect  Meaning Poverty indeed affects the brain  Well among a long list one of the practical aspects of South Asia Caste dynamic was onground access to resources The Upper Caste held better resources across generations  Meaning there are germline genetic artifacts in Indian Caste populationsgroups  Which brings to the last point that all this gfactor aspects are far more relevant to Groups than to Individuals This is statistical dynamic  The variability is high to determine 1 persons gfactor value and what that means for their future   However similar exercise for a Group ie a Groups gfactor is far more predictive of its future and its currently active capacities   Science doesnt care about human constructs that go through era based Taboo phases Science can be stopped for a while but eventually it will be out in the open regardless<new>that is true but a better average IQ would mean that the other half of the population will be much better off  I think this point was depicted on the OPs overview of the average indian watched kapil sharma slide highlighting the fact even though he IS at fault for making assumptions about what average is in our country that a clear majority of people combined from both above since the people in the above average IQ arent all intellectuals considering this is india were talking aboutor any country for that matter AND the below avg IQ vote for people they have knowledge about only at a surface level  I cant agree w everything said but its not a case study so pinning it for not supplying appropriate info isnt justified   What it does do is highlight the things you mentioned   TLDR   if we do have the highest avg IQ in the world yes the other half considering normal distribution for the sake of ease of deliberation since even skews bring the ratio heavier towards the below avg side very rarely towards the above avg side would be below average but even theyd be atleast be able to decide who and what theyre voting for  Theyll stop idolising their reps and become voters rather than devotees and act how the developed nationsexceptions exist act towards their representatives   No wonder our country doesnt have a properly leftist party yet<new>Baith ja lund pr<new>That applies to any country whatsoever<new>if there is one  If it had one FTFY  OP recently learned about Normal distribution Proper riamverysmart post<new>Its like going out and coincidentally seeing two road accidents in 10 minutes then coming to the conclusion that every person who drives has at least 1 accident in a week<new>If OP believes following a bell curve puts you in the top 10 as the one who drew said curve he must also be top 10  Also its just a sad attempt to stroke his and the readers ego to make them agree with him more easil6<new>It might not be funny sure thats subjective But how is it spreading misinformation when its literally characterised as a memesatire<new>Do you not understand satire<new>high coorelation of low IQ with stupid behavior  bro do you take an IQ test of everyone you talk to😂<new>Or because IQ tests measure abstract reasoning but while being 76 Iq point level of bad at abstract reasoning in an enviornment like a first world nation that trains children to do abstract thinking across all socio economic levels might indicate that you also have severe problem with dealing with daily tasks in india this doesnt at all mean that a 76 IQ person has any issues with the same daily tasks<new>Bro whatever reason there is it is simply not possible for the average Indian to have an IQ of 76 We would not have a functioning society if that were the case<new>Education is also a significant bias Lack of education does not imply lack of intelligence You’re seriously delusional if you think that an average Indian has an iq of 76 A person with that low of an iq cannot function in society by themselves<new>Sorry sarr galti ho

it never managed to get a clearly better result than the Placebo effect an effect that makes you feel better when you think you took medicine Most of the times when you have minor illnesses they just go away with time Thats pretty much how homeopathy rised in germany since it was competing with Bloodletting letting out blood to balance the humors very outdated way of thinking which was only making things worse so homeopathy had better results compared to that So yeah all in all it has an effect as long as you believe it has but same goes for regular medicine so we need studies with large groups of people to really tell if it works and homeopathy failed at that so far Behinde both lines are industries that will want you to tell you you need to buy their product Beeing sceptic is good and informing yourself but asking a second doctor is a better way to do that than the internet<new>I must be being delusional just because it was a normal thing in my family since I was born  I wouldnt call you delusional Its very normal for humans to accept the version of the world that they are presented with as kids by their parents Its very rare for people to ever question that when they reach adulthood Thats why most religious people have the exact same religion as their parents  Can i have links to those tests by the way  Sure heres a ton of links Knock yourself out

because their claims break the laws of reality The industry has existed since 1800s Theyve had plenty of time to prove their claims  Sceptic conjuror and escape artist James Randi has pledged one million dollars to anyone who can prove the efficacy of homeopathic remedies  Randi took an entire bottle of homeopathic sleeping pills 32 pills on stage in front of live audience in a bid to demonstrate that they dont induce any soporific effect  He challenged manufacturers to prove their claims and win 1000000 by submitting their remedies to a double blind test If they succeed the James

for generations in my family no one has faced any problems only person is my aunt from my fathers side even her son doesnt face problems so its person to person thats all medicine tbh<new> Dude OP legit drew a cutoff line for “Intelligence” and you see a serious tone with no hint of humour   There are more than enough people who believe intelligence is some kind of IQ threshold for this to be a serious post Not to mention its written exactly like those shitty WhatsApp forwards that are meant to make people feel smart and good about themselves and those are usually meant to be completely serious no matter how laughable their contents<new>If this post is parody to something then it may have been humourous if no then I dont see any point of funnyness in this  And drawing a cutoff line for intelligence isnt hint for humour there have been various attempts to mathify the intelligence  And I know Comedy is subjective Murray but is it this subjective I didnt know this<new>Sorry Im not equating Herbs can be dangerous  httpswwwhealthstatemnuscommunitiesenvironmentleadfsayurvedichtmlhttpswwwhealthstatemnuscommunitiesenvironmentleadfsayurvedichtml  x200B  Check liverdoc on twitter on issues with herbs<new>Chlorpyriphos   Not aware of it however some Ayurveda also have heavy metals like lead which can lead to permanent lowering of iq<new>Agreed   Secondly if in the name of the mandir the city is going to be developed then so be it   By this fact all cities with famous mandirs or religious places within it should be developed But sadly that doesnt happen  Only thing that happens is the place becomes overly crowded noisy dirty I cant remember a city with religiously significant pilgrim places which is more developed has prominent educational institutions or healthcare facilities   Some exceptions will definitely be there   In short itll not help nation in any possible way<new>There are people with very low intelligence in every societycountry these people have too low iq to hold any jobs and need governmentngoexternal assistance in their life Im not talking about these people   Yes intelligence is kind of fixed by birthgenes However in India we dont even reach our potential iq  critical thinking coz of the factors I mentioned These factors make our population less intelligentespecially diet and belief that veg is the best diet   1 Yes a broken democracy is better than dictatorship but both RW  LW will not mind dictator as long as the dictator holds the same view as them 2 The current broken democracy is also coz the opposition parties are pseudo seculars using caste  religion politics that antagonizes the other sideno way supporting any side and one party that thinks of one family instead of getting the best leaders to run the party  become a better party I think we need a party that doesnt cater to any religion or caste and does only helps by economic status 3 The 3rd point is difficult to quantify plus its slippery slope that will lead to eugenicsread nazi history Agree that our politicians need some education cutoff But in our country its very easy to get fake degrees heck its easier to even get fake experience certificates Even if you get good candidates people vote still depends on freebieshurts us very badly in long run caste and religionhindus muslims sikhs etc<new>So thats the catch it will be if everyone has equal opportunity since to begin with India has a very skewed distribution of wealth availability of education the Central limit theorem wont be applicable  It would make sense if you take a sample of 8th graders going to a government school with same availability of education then you look at the average students iq and the standard deviation of one of the schools   This can now be extended into a normal like distribution saying that the avg iq of an 8th grader going to a govt schoolthroughout the country is so and so and on an avg the iq of all 8th graders going to school is going to follow a normal distribution centered around the avg students iq from the school where data was originally collected  I hope this answer is satisfactory Id be happy to correct myself if Im making a mistake somewhere I dont primarily work with stats but this is my understanding in the subject so far<new>Which is exactly my point if you read my reply above I talk about how you can conduct an experiment and then expand it to a larger population while assuming a Gaussian  On the other hand it never talks about the iq of a nation or what you call as actual intelligence which I think are technically equivalent given the way the post talks about it The avg intelligence is not necessarily Gaussian<new>How would you even define “intelligence” Stating something meaningless the thing can be termed undefined at best or biased towards a particular worldview and calling it “objective fact” is grossly misleading A simple example Doing better at math tests is not a sign of intelligence Just because someone else has a different worldview even one that seems fully illogical to you does not mean they are unable to think properly   I strongly believe that most of our thought is based on heuristics we’ve built over the years through experience It is just that their heuristics are different and possibly faulty As an example a huntergatherer might be extremely intelligent when it comes to hunting prowess but might not have been able to do basic math Does that mean that the person is not intelligent Not at all It just means that their heuristics have been trained and refined to a much higher degree in their hunting endeavors but have not been trained in other areas  That said there is a good likelihood that certain inherited traits are a much better fit for the current consensus and so some people might be more naturally predisposed for success in our context That still does not mean that those not naturally endowed the degree to which this variation affects thought needs to be seen are irredeemable I still haven’t seen any data that is able to prove that this is the case  Finally this is a meme post poking fun at the broad assertions made through seemingly “scientific “ posts<new>Yeah but atleast they dont breed like chickens even after making it to a billion people  Imo atleast a minimum of 60 of Indians are a waste of resources and entropy and need to exit<new>Exactly  There is a joke in statistics  I interview 100 people who have played Russian Roulette in their lifetime And I came to the conclusion that all of them survived So its a completely safe game to play  The point is you have to use logic along with statistics Otherwise it can be the best liar in the world<new>Sure that may be implied but thats not what he literally said<new>Is making fun of dead kids satire<new>Maybe you dont because my statement was satire as well<new>Samples are enough You laugh but when you do you will realize Its funny until you take one yourself<new>I agree<new>Very true very sad to see people spreading psychology from WhatsApp University here People dont realise that people with severely low IQ Intellectually Disabled dont just have low intelligence but also struggle to perform basic tasks themselves<new>I agree but the post says them stupid Without knowing their mental state in such conditions and calling them stupid is not good imo But you are right they should have not done that But humans act out of desperation in hard times<new>two choices   1 spend last time with your child and accept he will go away forever after being together for years and raising him  2 Some hope of maybe his life can be saved and he can survive   the parents might not have been the smartest but in the most dire situation parent will make the choice that has even 01 chance of saving their child not saying ganga has 01 chance of saving someone from cancer Put some emotion into thoughts otherwise everyone has the same brain to think what you have stated<new>Well I don’t know Patanjali that’s why I don’t talk about it Homeopathy works for me and astrology doesn’t I chose what works for me and as long as it works I don’t plan to change I also don’t want all the side effects and dependencies Allopathy offers<new>Ayurveda has really helped me manage my chronic illness but should absolutely not be used to discount modern medicine<new>i agree thanks<new>so i personally believe homeopathy is bs and have never actually believed in it i approached this link with the intent of having some good proof to back me up when im telling someone that they shouldnt believe in homeopathy but actually upon reading the conclusions from the top 45 results they all say something along the lines of results showed that IH individualized homeopathy has better affect than just placebo large sample size warranted which doesnt prove my point lmao  not saying that im suddenly gonna start believing it because honestly ive done much more research through youtube on how its not exactly real but just gonna try searching for sources to back me up<new>These homeopathy folks are just believers  if you tell them about the sleeping pill experiment they will say that it will work only if taken in the night and person has good intention to sleep 😀<new>yeah but if you knew about homeopathy you should know it doesnt work like that There is no sleeping pill there is no cancer medicine no medicine for kidney stones    Different combinations of different medicines are administered over a usually long period of time to cure the symptoms how the patient feels     What claims does homeopathy make how does that break laws of reality like a tablet made from different elements from earth curing fever at least for a while<new>james what<new>That is true<new>I agree with this comment The only downside is because all that happened on 22012024 and there wont be another date more significant than that for religionbelief in our country That small economic spike will not go on forever<new>How do you want me to respond to that<new>no<new>idk man idk<new>yes it is and thats what Im saying it wasnt vitiligo at first But he gave me meds which incited all the cells which had the potential to become vitiligo hope u get what im trying to say and now im stuck w these white spots on my face for my life never knowing when theyll start spreading again and always living in the fear<new>If he wrote stupidity hornynessgreedcasteism etc instead of intelligence there would have been no difference🤣  I know how sadhguru has a mass appeal<new>Of course it is true that by and large building mandirs wouldnt do any good I like to think of it like tourism Not all tourist places are wellmanaged and good many become noisy and downright unpleasant   However there will be exceptions and considering how important this mandir appears to be I think that maybe it would be one of those exceptions though there isnt a solid ground that I base it on I am hoping for that best case scenario<new>Thanks for replying with such a logical detailed response we need more people like you I agree with every point you mentioned What I said previously is kind of extreme and I know it and I dont truly believe in it Its just that sometimes I lose hope on humanity and my mind slides towards extreme ideas<new>I was mainly disagreeing with your use of the central limit theorem there The central limit theorem has no role to play in this scenario because the probability distribution of each individuals IQ is designed to be a Gaussian by the IQ test itself We dont need to appeal to CLT for this conclusion<new>Your use of the term heuristics it itself part of what my comment was about  These are objective domain elements because they are solving for realobjective worldreality problems Heuristics to do what to survive thrive propagate to live and do whatever they want to do  Heuristics hence will exist on a Spectrum among a species organism simple Natural Selection Some individuals HeuristicsCapacity will be better than his or her peers  Brainmatter is not some mythicalsubjectiveetherdomain stuff It is matter objective stuff in reality  The fact that human species has something physiological as height that exists on a distribution and every other phenotype then the idea that ONLY AND ONLY Brainmatter would be something that will not showcase this property is a sign of lack of patternHeuristicsrecognizing cognitive capacity ie a Proxy because of all this semantic backforth of IQ EQ gfactor etc Indicator of Intelligence   Problems in reality are contextual What was relevant for human species 100000 years ago in African rift valley is not the same problems for someone living in 10 Million strong Urban cluster  However the instrument to solve those different problems is the same biological unit  There may even come an era where being highly Intelligent is dangerous and you get killed for it That reality will produce human individuals and collective group are are INHERENTLY less Intelligent because that is what is being selected for this wont be in the absolute for a while because one obvious answer to this is those highly intelligent will just get better at hiding it and then Heritability of Intelligence does the rest for their descendants But the collective will still suffer relative to what used to be  In fact interestingly research came out year or so back from UK data sets that showed TLDR Intelligence in recent times is being Selected Against ie more intelligent the person and couple less children they are having and less intelligent couples are having more Simple Natural Selection is happening slowly in that dataset    There is also similar theme research but outcome different from China using historic data where the Jinshi or others who cleared the Imperial Examination were undergoing millennialong Assortative Mating which further does gloading and their TFR was higher than regular population which makes sense even prima facie since clearing imperial examination meant more resources and better health etc hence more children surviving etc  Humans are trying to quantify using Real Scientific norms not social science nonsense this part of our existence It being subjected to Taboooutcast treatment is inherently a bad thing because in its absence will rise more bigotry  RacialEthnic outcomes are wellstudied now yet still more needs to be done This is not just about Test Scores this shows up in Life Outcomes A minor example of this was the US case of their Elite Universities having bias against Asians and discriminatory Affirmative Action probias for Black students  Reality is East Asians in US as a collective are gloaded by multiple Standard Deviations from Blacks This is beyond doubt the amount of practical data on this is gargantuan Social science hacks and their acolytes trying the la la la la I cant hear you strategy is only going to make things even worse because their solution is not going to resolve this difference  Remedy happens when problem is diagnosed properly Once its understood how big the difference then policy can come in that is tailored for the problem  Similar social science nonsense happened with Gender Parity stuff Nordic Gender Paradox eviscerated that garbage and now the social science hacks try insane bending over backwards mental gymnastics to plug the holes  Nordic Gender Paradox being the perfect example of If you NormalizeEqualize for InputOpportunity Outcome will be Natureloaded ie diverse  If you NormalizeEqualize for Outcome then Input HAS to be NonEgalitarian ie Affirmative Action Reservation System Quota corporate hiring etc etc  This is basic realities and these exist because that NatureNurture ratio is not 0100 or 1000 It is SOMEWHERE in the middle we just dont know what for what human elementphenotype  And post being meme is besides the point this is a debate thats either joked haha or just shut down on taboo grounds  Well Genetics is real So is heritability and so is basic statistical variability All these factors guarantee a Distribution will exist for ALL phenotypes including Intelligence what fadname it gets in different eras  What matters is research into it that is not gatekeeping locked<new>Go on internet and do some research Overpopulation is not real problem underpopulation is the real problem There are many Scientific research been done on this I think u r getting ur ideology from Thanos There are enough resources for all Americans consumes 3times more resources than we need Atleast we Indians dont do that The problem is multidimensional U cant make it unidimensional just by saying Overpopulation is bad or something Ask china They are scared of economic collapse because of lack of people<new>yes but in reality our subconscious brain keeps doing that all the time We should develop a habit to verify our statistical biases before forming stereotypes and stuff like that<new>Or their labelling their distraught parents as dumb<new>I actually see your point now youre right<new>You sound like you would have some studies to back what youre saying After all you are talking about correlation averages samples etc  Care to share it with me A study that shows any correlation between IQ and stupidity in India as you said I dont even know how that study would manage to measure stupidity<new>Dude I think you are just trying to defend his parents I understand that its traumatic for parents to know that their child is suffering but guess who is suffering the most Their child   Can indian parents stop making everything about themselves they killed their fucking child its the child who lost his life  And nothing like nothing justifies it if his parents couldnt handle him they should have left him in an orphanage ffs would have been better for him as well<new>But how didnt they realise that their child is drowning<new>Then you missed the point of those conclusions When they write that larger sample size warranted It means that the test was done on such a low number of people that the results could just as well be down to chance   In short the test conducted proved nothing because of the smal sample size  The larger the sample size the bigger the statistical significance the results will have However this is also more expensive<new>No food 30 minutes before and after taking pills is a must<new> What claims does homeopathy make how does that break laws of reality   1 Water memory 2 Extreme dilution of a substance removes harmful effects of it while preserving its therapeutic properties 3 Like cures like What causes also cures when diluted enough to not leave any significant existence of it in the solution<new>Different combinations of different medicines are administered over a usually long period of time to cure the symptoms how the patient feels      People who breathe air over a usually long period of time tend to get better from their illness too as long as the illness doesnt have a 50 fatality rate<new>I salute you for putting medicine in quotes Because there is no rationale or science behind what chemicals they choose to put in the pills   The preparations are manufactured using a process called homeopathic dilution in which a substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water  A typical homoeopathy dilution aims for 30C That is a dilution factor of 1060 This is what breaks the laws of reality To assume that something that is virtually non existent in your homoeopathic pills can have any effect on the disease that you are trying to affect<new>whatever you are claiming about how homeopathy works can be put to a randomized double blind test yet mone has been done so far the only reason homeo exists is because of blind faith like the one you are exhibiting lobbying and pretty lax rules around what is claimed as medicine in India<new>I see that you have done quite a bit of research in this topic I personally think it is a shame that the topic of human intelligence isnt studied in a more rigorous way as intelligence is one of the most important factors that affect every single one of us every day Unfortunately I dont think it will ever become mainstream in the near future due to massive controlling interests in the government and the general establishment who would never fund this   My only hope is for this to be privately funded by some billionaire If I ever become one I will definitely fund this<new>True<new>Their actions were dumb so its not wrong to call them dumb<new>Low IQ and Stupidity are correlated Worldwide Unless you believe India is some island where this does not apply<new>The child is too dead to suffer tbh Its the parents who are suffering for their actions now and being labelled as child killer And they will continue to suffer for years      They dont know science and shit Everyone says river ganga is miraculous what if they cleaned their son in that water If 1 minute didnt work in washing away his cancer maybe 2 minutes will work and so on     Yes what they did was absolutely wrong but its pretty dumb to not even try to understand why they did what they did when judging them     Because if you dont understand the why you might not be able to predict and choose your own options properly if a situation like that happens to you in a more time limiting constraint        1 Know what mistake they made    2 Know why they made that mistake   3 Avoid making the same mistake<new>Ah an average human being  known best for making rational decisions in the most dire of situations<new>that is a stupidity no one can explain except them idk how dumb were they<new>oooh that does sound very scammy    tbf we all know its impossible to explain how it works with our current knowledge of the world and biology so the people who made these claims dont actually have any credibility when theyre stating their opinions    Imo an average human being wont consume anything if they dont know how it works unless pushed by desperation maybe it was the conscious choice to increase the number of people who try it but any sane educated individual would see these 3 claims have so many logical loopholes that they can be denied easily<new>Air breathers have a 100 fatality rate<new>I agree but Ive seen at least 3 lethal casesthat i remember right now that conform to my bias  a family member getting normal after a very rare blood disorder another family getting tetanus to the point where their jaw was locking up and another friend of family whose kidney stone disappeared after 78 months    I would like to know more about the other opinions that are trying to discard homeopathy but most of these replies seem to be coming from people who have never tried it as administered and trying to counter my arguments just because its common knowledge<new>iirc and their rationale is this  if a substance causes x feeling when consumed diluting it and consuming it would treat symptoms yes youre right we dont know how it works yet  But again Not knowing how a system works is not the same as the system doesnt work    But removing everything that we dont understand from our data would just turn us narrowminded with no scope of future progress    It feels like if we were trying to introduce vaccination in 500BC the physicians and general populace of the time would discard it like people are discarding these opinions now<new>It will become mainstream Surveys sort of back this indirectly that is In recent years surveys about How Comfortable are you with using genetic screening these are now available esp with IVF though only limited number of companies doing this world over tools to increase the Intelligence of your child so not just limited to remove odds of future disease  India and China top these surveys Meaning fundamentally these societies are comfortable using it regardless of what they may say in public space or so  And this field be it research or consumergrade tech has a domino effect to it Once 1 human society starts doing it most of others who are on the fence or even against will eventually be on board because to be left behind on this is basically signing a death sentence to your group  If something has value it will eventually find use And then there is the matter of Degree of that Value and that is where genetic tools and brainresearch or Intelligence research exists as in the DegreeLevelAmount of value that can be gained from it is so massive we dont even know the limits of it yet So it will happen we are just going through a fad that can last decadesgenerations mainly because of Western dominance of this field and thus Western sociocultural legacy baggage  South Asians  East Asians have been using Assortative Mating basically genetic level manipulation among its populations for millennia This is why they are culturally less on a gradient averse to this Were just behind on tech currently so its not as visible This is temporary  What may prolong it the fad that is in India is petty Caste Politics but it wont be able to do this for long Parents wanting better and better for their kids is biologically baked in politics cant upend this beyond a certain timeframe<new>Bro how are you even going to measure stupidity You first need to measure things in order to say they are correlated Also you didnt provide any study  httpspreviewredditb89di45ilrec1jpegwidth244formatp<sep>',\n",

more intelligent than others  Only very unintelligent people are usually willing to admit they are belowaverage at all somewhat unintelligent people think theyre average or above average intelligence but the more intelligent somebody thinks they are generally the more accurate their selfperception  Dunning Krugers study suggests that those who think theyre in the top 10120IQ might actually be like

well documented that non English speakers do worse on IQ tests Do you seriously believe that the average Indian is clinically mentally retarded<new>IQ is just a small part of human intelligence<new>Iq is not the true measure of intelligence<new>IQ is a baseless parameter to judge intellectual capability What you are really asked in a general IQ test is basic maths and some extra One to excel in it just need to prep for that specific metric and youll do fine with a score of 100 We have a lower IQ bc education quality from primary level sucks especially in the maths dept which forms the basis of such tests   But then again ppl hold the cards to throw such jibe at anyone i cant go and correct everyone<new>Human iq scores typically follows a normal distribution though While ops assumptions of

spices and herbs<new>this was not a dig towards a party it has always been the case… but more effort should be to push the avg towards left<new>As a german I confirm the last statement since homeopathy originates from germany and we have within europe probably the biggest problem with this alternative medicine There is an entire pharma industry around it and the approval of their medicine has a seperate set of guidelines since they cant fullfill scientific ones like every real medicine<new>Bro idk about yall but homeopathy did work for menot once but every single time<new>The body is very good at healing itself This could be what you have interpreted as  homeopathy working Even though the observed healing had nothing to do with the Homeopathy being administered   Thats why scientific double blind tests are necessary to figure out what works and what doesnt   Spoiler alert homeopathy has been tested many times and has never passed a single scientific double blind test<new>Yeah only you have seen it But the whole homeopathic industry can not prove it or show it to the rest of the world conclusively<new>Belief is the fucking engine of our country   Ive seen my own intellectual and smart friends on whom homeo works and I believe it would work on me too if I believe   I used to be extremely religious once I came out of that life seemed so much bleaker I kid you not I went from being an overweight virgin who couldnt talk to women for the life of him to almost being a Chad for an year but to be brutally honest when I introspect about the larger things in life it all seems so much bleaker than it used to earlier And I know if I can just start believing again shit will get happier too   Look at any Indian company which has been torn to shreds by independent researchers or rocked by large scams How many of them actually succumbed Our population as a whole can believe shit into existence   When roughly 500600 million people can believe with all their hearts that a building in Ayodhya is somehow going to benefit their lives and improve the nation IT WILL cause everyone believes it will and they act accordingly They spend more they go out with family and friends they express they celebrate bro this is how you counter recessions make the common man happy and carefree enough to spend   Ive long stopped taking part in discussions of such nature but this is one view I kinda want peoples thoughts on is our population delusionally retarded or am I<new>Some disease doesnt need any medicine to heal  Our body can also heal itself<new>Ive seen it work on lil kids who dont have a brain capable of forming coherent thoughts so I doubt it is the Placebo effect  Kids can be effected by how parents and people react If the parents arent stressed or are hopeful then the kid wont be stressed  httpswwwnhsukconditionshomeopathy  If water had a memory of whatever has been in it before you would be drinking a putrid concoction of sulphurs and shit every time you had a glass of water<new>Its important to keep in mind things that are relieving are not always curative  Whiskey for example  But usually anything that improves patient outlook is good for the patients health<new>That’s because of a Placebo and the bigger reason b Steroids So many of their products are laced with steroids which work miraculously in the short term They won’t cure whatever is wrong but they’ll stop you from feeling most symptoms  And that’s why people who take wayyyyy too many end up with so many complications and we have to see young children with these problems the most <new>Placebo effect is real bro<new>1 As pointed placebo effect 2 Modern medicinenot traditional go through double blinded studies httpsenwikipediaorgwikiBlindedexperimentDoubleblindtrialshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBlindedexperimentDoubleblindtrials 3 Your supporting companies that make this sh1t 4 People dont take modern medicine but end up with traditional medicine that might lower standard of living or death 5 Overall acceptance of such sh1t grows in society<new> so I doubt it is the Placebo effect  I dont think you understand placebo effect It just means that the treatment itself is no better than random chance It has nothing to do with patients coherent thoughts In some cases it works and others it doesnt<new>Might be simply the kids immune system fighting whatever disease they had<new>there have been multiple researches concluding it is placebo<new>It works only on illnesses that would have fixed themselves in time For anything else you are out of luck<new>It comes under the same catagory of all the voodoo stuff temple priests or pastors from church does They also have the same level of success rate  If homeopathy works then these black magic also works<new>True I agree there is no scientific basis for homeopathy yet or that the research is hidden by the allopathic mafia as per a conspiracy lol But I have seen homeo medicine work more often than not even for a little serious diseases This makes me not wanna disapprove of homeopathy right away but I wont approve of it either until its credibility is proven<new>true im not against scientific research but Homeopathy just works for me and no harm in it atleast<new>We must not forget the vested financial interest pharma industry has in ridiculing alternate health related solution Its almost existential for them   We saw during covid on how systematically they made fun of ivermectin that worked for MILLIONS of ppl But pharma was getting incentive to push vaccines so they paid millions to ridicule ppl who used ivermectin hydrochloroquin vit D etc  All Im saying is dont laugh at any natural solution without applying it first We may never know what works Stories of the process got passed over multiple generations for a reason Theyd have seen it work ans thats how things get passed down Our generation has been sold the idea that pharma industry is the only truth cz its in their best interest Anything else is an existential threat to pharma mafia<new>You Youre that stupid person were talking about here<new>How many times have you seen it do absolutely nothing It’s confirmation bias<new>What issues did the lil kids have <new>Placebo effect is 100 due to psychological factors like pain relief but also due to others like regression to mean Like they say you can cure a cold in 7 days or wait it out a week<new>I doubt it is the Placebo effect  Your issue is doubting the placebo effect Thats it It can literally help cure cancer by giving them nothing   For real Thats it Thats always been what it is Theres literally no other explanation because even homeopathy cant explain it<new>The fact that your comment is currently in the positives is very telling<new>Placebos work even when you know theyre placebos The danger with homeopathy is that the patient requires a lower standard of rigour backing their treatment If they believe that what else could they be made to believe<new>Ohh Homeopathy is already proven to not work Avogadros number already proves that you need to know basic chemistry to understand that   Heck Kurzegast made a video about that httpsyoutube8HslUzw35mcsisaCGWsxzm56OFlS  Homeopathy was never scientific it is as old as blood letting Clinical trials have already been conducted and it is already proven false by established doctors I would suggest you to add this video in your OG comment  I guess the bigger problem is not having information or not wanting to have information Like you said conduct experiments whereas 7 different Universities have already done so independently but we still wanna believe a 18th century book from a guy who was not even a doctor<new>It actually is the placebo effect Even the youngest of kids are able to understand when something is being done for them to tend to them If they have any trust in their parents then theyll be undergoing it with no problem<new>It works because they just pump in allopathic medicine in name of homeopathy   The core concept of dilution in pseudo science but what this people do is just give allopathy medicine in name of homeopathy<new>people have to first conduct some experiments if it works or not before coming to the conclusion that it straight up cant work  They have the shit that works becomes medicine<new>This is because in India people give these homeopath remedies for anything and everything including aches and pains that will likely go away on their own in an hour or so      So you see it work because many illnesses just take some time to overcome      You might be surprised to know in western nations its not uncommon to own and take little to no meds at all Like if I get a cold I dont go to the doctor or pharmacy I just though it out and drink lots of liquids Do I die      Stomach ache Probably just indigestion or something Again if I just thought it out and wait it gets better     My point is homeopathy appears to work only because time is the main factor for most illness Your immune system or natural course of events eventually solves the problem      But homeopathy has about a 100 failure rate when curing things that are more serious and require medical attention like gun shot wounds broken bones cancer and so on     You hear about the successes but not the failures because of selection bias Also people lie alot for fame and money    I was shot but I stuffed my wound with religious flowers and it was healed the next day Blatant lies      Also many homeopathy cures just include using the raw ingredients from modern medications which arent as concentrated but will provide some relief or similar effects For example there is alot of raw natural pain killers Honey and many other things can help sooth a sore throat      Also there is simple physics solutions as well Hicups can be cured by holding your breath If you cant keep food down because of food poisoning or alcohol poisoning you chug an Alkaseltzer in water and the carbonation boats your stomach so that it cant heave<new>It doesnt work and there is no credible literature to say that it does<new>Kaha se khale chale gaye bhai Aliens are just a speculation at this point of time<new>Ur true and I got to know I am stupid  can u plzz explain<new>Yeah you are one of them<new>Exactly<new>Well writing a big whole post on serious tone with lot of criticism and no hint of humour and just using a meme flair to hide behind it doesnt make it a joke post<new>it is a joke lmao calm the fuck down<new>you are definitely in that 07B lol<new>I mean it was aunt who drowned the kid and was laughing after so 💀<new>The whole ganga incident is sad  tragic story  I know what they did was wrong but how is it different from taking traditional medicineAyurveda unani homeopathy etc from terminal illnessthey could have toxins or dangerous substances leading to poor standard of

em do this shit People get ready to kill someone else in such situations just to save their loved ones One of the best examples of this comes from a video game called the last of us The main character passes on the opportunity to save millions because he would have had to lose a girl which was like a daughter to him Im not using a game as an example to justify any of this but this was the best way I could put this in wordsI hope you understand what Im trying to say<new>Also lot of banned pesticides insecticides Modern medicine known to have terrible side effects  traditional medicines that dont

colleges  basic medical clinicsno hospitals Apart from very handful of people the priority were in support of those religious buildings<new>Mandir is built so the newer generations can know that ramayan mahabharat and other epics are not epics are not story or myths rather they are THE HISTORY OF INDIA   Talking about education country is trying their best but whats the use when even the highly educated redditers cant understand that one small temple doesnt drain out the whole treasury of a 14 billion populated nation and its to CONTINUE THE CULTURE AND RICHNESS OF INDIAN HISTORY<new>how many times are you going to blame that temple   httpswwwgooglecomampsbfsieconomictimesindiatimescomampnewsindustryayodhyarammandirhowmuchmoneywasspentandwhatdoesupstandtogain107045031   it was built using donations which were more than 3500cr from PEOPLE govt didnt pay shit whatever UP govt will spend it will be spent on redeveloping the city of Ayodhya not the temple the amount of revenue this single city will generate is north of 20 fcking thousand crores the govts from here onwards will continue to benefit from the donations that temple will get for centuries like Tamil Nadu or Kerela does from theirs<new>That was not my point  Democracy needs better educationalspecially in critical analysis so that each voter casts his vote correctly Different voting score will lead to abuse by the usual suspects and lead to bad system<new>You dont need born rich to go abroad   1 A lot of parents take loan to send their students abroadwho work part time their to supplement Canada alone earned 5B by Indian students who after completion settle in that countryvisa makes it easy to find job  settle 2 A lot of IT workers settled abroadit has become little bit diff now plus lot of kids are born in that country which makes them foreign country citizens making it easier for parents to settle once the kid is 18 years old<new>It wasnt marked as Memes when it was posted Must have edited it after the response This is the signature style of post for OP in other subs as well None of them are marked as Memes<new>Whowhat is it satirizing and whats the give away that its satire All of this is exactly the kind of thing you hear all the time from people who get high on their own farts without a clear indication that its mocking those kinds of people If it truly is meant to be satire and the flair isnt just a CYA against backlash its not very good<new>Umm as a person who does mathematics for a living this definitely is a shitpost and makes no sense at all  India definitely could have a skewed iq distribution and whatever mathematics this guy has done is just to make it sound like theyre smart but arent indeed  As for normalGaussian distributions go you can assume the iq to be Gaussian only when there is equal chance equal randomness for everyone to have a specific iq thereby you assume that if the population size is large enough it will end up being a normal curve   Now in the context of the entire country not everyone has equal opportunity to education and hence the normal distribution assumption is incorrect even when you talk about a large population You can read up on central limit theorem for more details on this<new>I understood the point of the post that India needs to work on education and other factors to increase the intelligence of its people I completely agree with that We are nowhere near our full potential in fact we are quite lacking  What I am saying is our population is what it is Its not going through major changes for decades to come And if our IQ is normally distributed half the population is always going to be below average Thats a fact It doesnt matter how much we increase the intelligence We can have the highest average IQ in the entire world half the population will still be below average<new>Normal distribution is part of statistics btw  Tell us more Sir Isaac Newton<new>By this same logic wouldn’t the reverse be true “Due to the sheer amount of people we have…the ABOVE average as defined by the middle of the curve part of our society is twice the US population” By this same logic there are massive amounts of below average intelligence and massive amounts of above average intelligence people in India So I’m not understand the point What am I missing<new>OP has a point Maybe the math aint mathing or that is cases referred on the drowing case aint factual but he do have a point  Most of the Indians are stupid<new>I often use xkcdhttpsxkcdcom style memes and graphs at work during technical presentations It puts a smile on the attendees and they are likely to empathize with you<new>I actually really liked this style of presentation Simple and gets the point across if there is one Might even use it myself 😊<new>Of course it does But I dont see why you would talk about so many things in the post that dont have any factual basis<new>Agreed but still youd see people remaining unemployed yet not willing to take a job slightly lower than their preference Youd see people whod remain unemployed but wont be doing something worthwhile Makes you think their preferences are more or less determined by social prestige societal expectations and cultural norms and less economic<new>Its funny to me when somebody claims that someone literally said something then misquotes what they literally said<new>It isnt even funny Just spread of misinformation<new>An elitist meme should be called out<new>Ooohh so much this Some of the most highly skilled and competent people Ive worked with are always hesitant to accept  the expert tag shoved on them The least competent ones are the ones who tag themselves as experts<new>You are the classic example of the DunningKruger effect atleast you are self aware<new>If we tried to plot an Indian person of average intelligence among Indians on the USs IQ distribution that person would have an IQ of 76 on that scale   But yes that same person would be 100 on Indias scale because IQ tests are graded or created in such a way that 100 comes to be the average   Youve a good point but the average Indian is dumber than the average American or equivalently an average person from the developed world<new>If you really interact with the avg person on the street in India you will notice a high coorelation of low IQ with stupid behavior<new>It doesnt but when IQ is on the extreme ends its a big problem and is indicative of education culture and general health  70 is extremely low for any country<new>I agree Someone with an IQ of 76 in lets say America has severe learning disabilities They have trouble with concepts such as nested reasoning for example imagining a past version of them dreaming about their future etc They have limited to no capacity of performing any sort of work that is not repetitive manual labor all this is as per Jordan Peterson who is a well known psychologist  On the contrary the average man you pick out of the street is very much capable of doing their stuff and existing in the world The average farmer has understanding of crops pests animal husbandry working with tools and fixing tools that break in the farm mathematics for prices etc I dont think they are near 76 IQ at all  I think this number is so low simply because enough good studies have not been done on the average IQ of Indians Even if one wants to do such studies that actually have scientific rigour nobody wants to fund them because studies on IQ are deeply unpopular Unfortunately that puts a hard stop to this endeavour as good IQ testing is not cheap<new>IQ tests do not test language skills Besides what youre saying could be true 5060 years ago but since then there has been an emphasis on culturefair IQ tests<new>East Asian nations are non english What about them  Just accept the fact<new>No it isnt but it measures pattern recognition working memory spatial ability and such things that are all pretty important for things like maths science and similar IQ then would mean that indians on average are terribly bad these specific skills Well and as genetics is totally unplausible to be the cause  india must be poisoning its children with industrial waste chemicals malnutriate in early childhood and give bad education especially in early childhood It would then to be expected that theres a stark IQ difference between lower class children and children coming from families that are well off enough to shield their children from such factors impacting brain development  are their stats showing such a gap<new>Not surprised this is your best comeback Just proves my point<new>My guy not the best way to handle this situation lmao<new>Im not calling someone dumb because they watch Kapil Sharma Even I have watched Kapil Sharma  I am calling them dumb who only watches shows like Kapil Sharma Big Boss and nothing else<new>Theres a manifesto provided during every election cycle and a lot of past data related to each party to look at  A person that can make decisions from themselves will go through them and then decide which party to vote  A person incapable of that looking at you would be in tune with for example what the manipulated media tells them and maybe even what their parents would be voting for<new>OP is in the top 1 and is smarter than everyone else He already knows the ins and outs of every single thing don’t try to teach him stuff with your average intelligence<new>I thought Postmorten says suffocation caused death Water in lungs etc<new>It does not help but you have to understand parents can get desperate in such situations<new>atleast he didnt die of cancer<new>I mean I am talking about those in the urban areas<new>Which country is the gold standard for you You are the one who brought europe into discussion i mention europe and immediately you start asking me why is the most powerful european country a gold standard lol<new>I have just completed school in my freshman year in an engineering college I have not looked into the principles of homoeopathy yet will look into it<new>It works for me and my family and placebo or not all I want is cure without side effects so it’s perfect for us and a lot of people I know I also don’t think they will still be running dispensaries if it didn’t have any good effects but that’s just my personal view on this<new>since graph is showing me in 90th percentile red character on one of the slides who understand the bell curve and im not indian i assume that the curve is for all people not just indian   also the curve was supposed to illustrate how smart is the nation is which you can only do in comparison to other people  so in this case the median of avg indian in between of entire earth population may not be in the middle<new>Not only in India  There’s a  branch of alternate medicine in Chinese culture too  tcm traditional Chinese medicines People flock to these shops same way Indian flock to homeopathy<new>Right   no wonder big pharma would hate losing on zillions of dollars   Homeopathy has been said to be ineffective  but i wonder if its actually true Yes has and hasnt worked for me a lot of times So  i am not sure if it works or not<new>  Spoiler alert homeopathy has been tested many times and has never passed a single scientific double blind test  I am shocked SHOCKED<new>ffs that spoiler alert     like if it works should it not pass ONE blind test what a joke    Can i have links to those tests by the way    If the blind tests were conducted properly and failed I must be being delusional just because it was a normal thing in my family since I was born<new>No I meant if you dont want to believe it why not try it out    There might be other reasons that can lead to an industry not proving something too btw But yes I think its fair to only believe in the things that have been proven because everyone doesnt have enough time to try out everything that has been proven and everything that hasnt been<new>My thoughts on your question is Our brain loves to immerse itself in delusions It might be traced back to finding patterns that helped in survival when evolving but it can still be seen in all of humanity The brain tries to form a pattern in completely random data and add its bias to it After finding that pattern a few times the brain stops trying to find a pattern and defaults to the previous pattern when the bias gets big enough    Second thing the brain does is to usually accept the patterns someone else points out in a random data increasing the existing bias    The flaw in it is that all the observations that dont conform to that bias are usually kinda ignored while every time that imperfect bias helps in predicting something the bias gets stronger  I dont think its wrong I mean we evolved this way and it didnt go wrong in so many centuries and millennia    But imo it should be a criteria for each individual to assess their bias and things that might be influencing the bias if they want to label themselves as sentient    No need to doubt your beliefs life will work out somehow but if you want to differentiate yourself from the animals who develop habits like we develop beliefs you have to doubt your beliefs     What are your thoughts on this<new>I get your point But relying on the population believing such things can do only so much That building in Ayodhya will definitely not solve recessions even if 1B people go and spend their money there Even if many of our countrymen are gullible They wont believe that the building in Ayodhya will magically increase there wealth They wont spend more during recessions The only thing that building will accomplish is increasing domestic tourism to Ayodhya and smallscale tourism related businesses in Ayodhya will flourish Ayodhya will become a slightly richer city than it already is<new>Now i want to know if PM did thali bajao drama so people believe they can defeat corona corona is not a threat<new>a relative of mine made his wife sneak in cocaine in the hospital when he was on his death bed<new>hmm yes that might actually be true but imo before trying it its just dumb of us to assume it doesnt work just because 1 it cant be proven right now and 2 mainstream industry doesnt recognise its effects    I mean we have developed such a great logic system why not use it when assessing new information    like René Descartes Consider false any belief that falls prey to even the slightest doubt<new>Tf they put steroids in it as well<new>0 can I have links please<new>this is the second dumbest response Ive seen today after if we dont understand how it works now then when will we   Youre classifying all the things and interactions in the world as either Things you understand or Things you dont understand     Its common sense to think that things you understand should work but its such an obvious fallacy to discard all the things you dont understand as unreal<new>Placebo effect works for everything even in  cancerhttpswwwscientificamericancomarticleplaceboeffectacureinthemind  Honestly a good doctor wouldnt mind his patients using homeopathy of Ayurveda on the side because it can actually help them even without a scientific basis  too often doctors are pissed bc it just hurts their business lol<new>no harm yet you mean there might be harms that we cant assess right now    By the way the creationor beginning of homeopathy was pretty interesting    And iirc the concept is this  If eating this stuff makes you feel xyz then diluting that stuff 46389164828638191 times consuming that diluted solution will cure that xyz feeling instead<new>Just letting you know homeopathy does harm people When I was a kid I got fever and after that I got a little white spot beside my lips My family took me to homeopathic doctor and we told him not to make it spread just end it right there and then And guess what he did He spreaded it on half of my face and it became vitiligo<new>I agree  I think our diets and things that are healthy to us became healthy because of consumption over so many years over the process of evolution Our body is used to working with it It would also mean new diets might change the path we evolve into 0<new>I think all my replies are downvoted D<new>Search Area 51 Activism groups<new>Dude OP legit drew a cutoff line

and Chlorpyriphos has actually been documented to reduce IQ in babies<new>Yes Its a fairly common thing across various religion Our country needs to get its priority straight<new>Wait a second Mandir is built so the newer generations can know that ramayan and mahabharat and other epics are not epics but they are the HISTORY OF INDIA  There are 2 problems with this argument a Ramayan and Mahabharat are epics because   i Ramayan and mahabharat just like any events of religious significance have been twisted ie there are fictional elements along with the historical ones Just like for example the Bible we know Jesus existed but do you believe that he walked on water Do you believe that he actually rose from the dead I suppose not Would you say that teaching all of the bible as history is a good choice I suppose not Why dont you apply this logic to your religion as well    ii When you build a mandir or a place of religious worship only people of that religion will visit there So the Mandir is not going to teach anyone about their history only reinforce what the believers believe   However having said all that I am not against building of Ram Mandir I simply dont care In fact I think prudentially speaking that it will help the economy of Ayodhya Secondly if in the name of the mandir the city is going to be developed then so be it But you should not hide in the veil that the mandir is to showcase history its there as a place of worship period   Is the building of the Mandir a suboptimal choice yes But the most optimal choice of building educational hubs improving healthcare doesnt make headlines so it will never get votes so it wont be implemented<new>Wrong sub budd<new>Bhai ramayan mahabharat ki kitaabon ka prachar karne Wale bahot hai   Toh use mandir se

make people the bs he says Every parent wants their child to be healthy  He will consult everyone whom he believes The parent must have thought that the blessings of the God would be on his child and by chance his kid would get better after treatmentIt is unfortunate that the child has died  In the same scenario what if the kid does not die after taking a dip in the ganga and gets better after the treatment will you say God is real This person will ridicule anyone who doesnt think like him or what he says He just called half of the population based on ONE case He  thinks he is intelligent just because he rejects the ideology of God      And the lieracy rate of the US is just 78  with a hugely small population of 330 million And our population 14 billion and still there are more educated indians than twice the whole population of the US    And he will reply then  why is US is more developed than india   The work force of America is mixes of races across the world And the most earning ethnic group in America are Indians The same people this guy labelled as illiterate     Not every one in India is stupid like you and not every one is intelligent like Srinivas Ramanujan  Sir or HC

people are dumb irrational social animals This holds true if you go to the adivasi tribe in Andaman and Nicobar islands or London     Secondly the Bell curve as a concept was introduced by Eugenicists in order to weed out the weak humans by taking away their rights as even you mentioned that they have the power to vote have them euthanised or justify their genocide Its a very cruel chapter of human

theres a pretty high amount of people in the US Canada and the UK who believe in the same or similar things The royal family in the UK has a generations long relationship with homeopathy and belief in

your analysis Intelligence and knowledge are not the same Now the Bell curve in itself has a few flaws We cant assume the average intelligence is in the middle It would be towards either of the sides And intelligence is multifaceted not a straightforward thing You saying if someone knows how to use Reddit knows English you categorized them into the top 10 percent of smart people Thats a blunder If youre saying this you might not be in the top 10 Im sorry to say Also the western standards of intelligence used to measure intelligence quotient and shit are pretty outdated Anyways we do still have people who believe that ganga water can cure cancer So theres no point in having these discussions without first acting on educating people Its not their intelligence many Indians are brainwashed into believing all sorts of things Even the most intelligent person wouldnt know if theyre being brainwashed Unless he has the required knowledge to find that out And people of India are too trusty Easily trust people And the people they trust are not knowledgeable to be trustworthy Their dumbness would spread very easily Just like this post and people who beloved it without actual thought Coz someone

intelligence of Indians follows a normal distribution curve Without any data And even if it does follow what is the lowest intelligence according to it Why is it zeroHow would you measure a thing like intelligence which is a qualitative trait not a quantitative How does genetics play a role in this It should right Why dont half the people have intelligence genes Why does only 10 have intelligence

Hajmola always works for my upset stomach  I don’t think homeopathy is all bad  Many medicines are just synthetic versions of plants<new>ek video dekhi thi maine koi science ki video thi uske comments

for so long This isn’t an epiphany this was always the case<new>offending someone without offending whata genius<new>How can you just assume that it is normally distributed Maybe atleast use CLT But your findings will be highly biased if your assumptions are baseless and your distribution follows just your best guess<new>Why are people taking a post tagged satire seriously Kinda makes me think that op actually has a point<new>At least 50 not smart  which is why BJP is in power<new>Believes in Homeopathy LMAO<new>So everyone is stupid except OP youre just retarded<new>Imo education is not the solution People holding the highest of degrees have the stupidest superstitious belief systems Instead of school system education there should be a drive to educate how to become more receptive of opposing ideas in a respectful way in order to facilitate a healthy discussion and bring changes In the positive way ofc<new>Once There were some rumors about how google AI gained sentience and can act like a human    You can find audio clip on YouTube   So I showed my parents   My mom said its all because of God which was quite weird I dont believe in God I believe something beyond exist but I dont believe that person is God who is helpfulkindand other good description  I dont really hate it that my mom believe in God to that extent cause you know world is so big   Imagine if every person who believes in God is suddenly shown the reality of the world   That there is no God every being is a living being trying to survive in it some survive by doing good and creating groups some survive alone  Like if one day aliens started popping out and started killing humans no God will come   Just like how no God comes when an animal eats a human or kills a human<new>Sigh current budget for

read that again<new>What a brilliant post<new>Bro I have never seen such dumb argument in my life before like think about it watching Kapil Sharma is dumb really thats what you use as quotient of intelligence Treating cancer with ganga water is Marta kya na krta dead can do anything to survive and who told you that his treatment wasnt going on noone do these things when they are in good condition How much do you know about medical scene Considering you are just an ordinary person Bura he dekhan mai chla bura na milya koi je mai aapko dekhiya mujhto bura na koi when I looked for evil person I found noone when I saw my conscious there is nothing more evil its a loose translation but who you got the point please apply this to your life You are just some stupid guy thinking to be smart when you got good schooling education and health and you are still being ordinary you are just a butt hurted nihilistic guy<new>India is a is a extremely diverse country you can see the 21 st century in tier one cities the 19th century type villages just couple Kilometres from the city and medieval type villages with electricity and internet in the rural areas that’s why the drowning in Ganga race riots and witch trials Like in Salem the in parts of the county happen and stuff like this is blind to happen have the largest population have the greatest number of dummies<new>Wow sir you really can do maths do answer a logical question for me if people in your country are really not that smart and you are a genius so wouldnt it be better to switch the country rather than blaming its people I mean you really dont question a donkey for being a donkey right Or this post was just to satisfy your ego by displaying how smart and knowledgeable you are Which again seems a hollow thought<new>httpspreviewredditjjrqdnwcuxec1jpegwidth295formatpjpgautowebps370fcecb32d600f7028c5ab7c7f53a48a5b7f160<new>Lol<new>Tbh the 6th slide isn’t wrong 😂 that’s the common Indian and it

share your pain<new>bro when you dont know about something you should not speak that was a genuine procedure god can save lives and cure diseases 🙏🏻❤️ It was his bad luck that he ran out of breath before the ritual was finished on shanti 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️<new>Our education system is also screwed up and outdated The goal of Indian education is to train kids to become ready for 95 jobs 1 Follow what your teachers superiors say without questioning 2 Compete with your fellow classmates not collaborate 3 No focus on developing critical thinking skills 4 Hyper focus on marks KPIs  Just educating more people is not enough as many educated people have become “smart” at doing their jobs and earning their wages but are still dumb in many other respects This type of education is even worse because these people become over confident in their ignorance  We need to revamp our education system at the most fundamental level in order to have a renaissance moment in India and transform our country’s future<new>Wow so everyone whose ideology doesnt conform with OP is dumb and should not be allowed to vote<new>With the current leading party Indias education level is never gonna boost up But sure it can go down with the propagandas that are running in the nation<new>Redditor moment<new>Indians have got higher fertility rate as compared to the caucasians What an average white cant do even after having intercourse for 10 times an Indian couple can make it happen in just 23 times\\xa0<new>It’s an amazing culture<new>All i can hear is a petulant child whining Thank God you discovered intelligence<new>Doesnt help that there are official homeopathic medicine degrees that give legitimacy to the doctors If you think about it from the perspective of the average Joe I dont know medicine but the guy has studied medicine and has an official degree after learning from other guys who have studied medicine and yeah the government recognizes this degree so lets defer to him The same exact reasoning we use to defer to actual doctors Theres no faithanecdote here Now add these to the fact that a Theres barely anyno access to proper medicine and basic medical education for such folks and b positive feedback from peers given the fact that most common illnesses are cured by timeplacebo effect The government should derecognize such degrees and penalize them practicing as an official or official sounding doctors   Also a tangent but homeopaths constantly bash true medicine as western mumbo jumbo science and sneakily ignore the fact that homeopathy also originated from the West<new>man i dont wanna believe it but idk why it works    Ive seen it work on lil kids who dont have a brain capable of forming coherent thoughts so I doubt it is the Placebo effect there might be another reason but for that people have to first conduct some experiments if it works or not before coming to the conclusion that it straight up cant work<new>Homeopathy is majorly based on the placebo effect and I believe that it shouldnt be disturbed because of the benefits it has for the believers I dont really follow homeopathy I follow ayurvedic medicine and sometimes allopathymodern medicine<new>Only until it becomes a life and death problem Then these idiots run to AIIMS lol<new>Both my brother and I had SEVERE asthma and Sinusitis during our childhood We used to visit various hospitals every week But nothing workedEven if the English medicines worked it used to become normal after a week or so Somebody suggested homeo to my parents and my dad studied homeo for months and I used the medicine for literally 3 days YES I know the reputation of Homeo these days but it really worked for us After 3 days my dad took me to an icecream shop and told me to eat the ice cream if I wished to I did and even then the asthma didnt come back Ever since our whole familys been using homeo medicines for various ailments and it works<new>I mean western medicine hawks a lot of bullshit too Meds that are even more damaging than the primary condition often And many people here don’t even question it Pharma simps<new>but it works right i have very good evidence that it works I had polypus in my nose when i was like 7 or 8 took homeopathy and got cured My sister had a bone issue in her wrist the doctor told surgery is the only option  took homeopathy for about a year and it got cured My Gf take KP x6  a homeopathy medicine for anxiety focus and all Ive genuinely seen improvement in her mood you would say its just Placeboand Maybe it is but physical condition doesnt get cured from placebo<new>Honestly I do believe in homeopathy cuz Im literally a living breathing example of it actually working I had high BP as a kid like very young age n alopathy was working but some of the results were very wishy washy we consult a hell of a lot of doctors and specialist but still same thing wishy washy results But then we decide to give homeopathy a try n it took years but it did eventually work I no longer suffer from high blood pressure even I was very sceptical of this but I now do trust it also I had an encounter at an herb garden to this day I still remember Rauvolfia serpentina  same thing which I was told to just use a 2 drops of this concentrate everyday and I kid you not my blood pressure just fell down like a rock idk if it was because of that specifically but it was very very interesting  Edit I didnt believe it till I got the results n I had real time results where my pills went from 2 to 1 to 05 n just for my sake 05 every half a month I doubt its placebo<new>Dude homeopathy works I had some urinary issues and even after multiple tests some of which were very painful and sessions of antibiotics it was not curing  Doctors tested me for kidney infection stricture UTI and God knows what other but everything was clean and this is not just one doctor or one lab I tried 34 doctors who are best here and their recommended labs but nothing worked  Then my in laws suggested me homeopathy and I went to see a homeopathic practitioner he prescribed me a medicine which costed 180 rupees for 100ml just 6 drops before sleeping and I am using it from past one year and the issue is gone 999   Also there are some things which modern science couldnt explain there is a friend of mine whose younger brother is an MBBS doctor in my city and he took his mother to a baba type healer to cure dhan khisakna its something like slipping of some internal organ in stomach due to which she was suffering from extreme pain and being an MBBS doctor he tried everything possible in his city but nothing worked but 2 sessions with that baba cured her issue   I have similar experiences with Ayurveda also when allopathy failed to cure something Ayurveda cured it in a week and that too very cheaply given you found an honest practitioner  So I suggest everyone not to like or dislike a pathy or healing method until unless its treatment or prescription sounds utter nonsense like drowning in river if it can cure you or give you relief without or with minimum side effects then use it<new>Sometimes after a lot of allelopathy only sometimes no medicine is better than some medicine i guess thats probably how homeopathy works<new>Not exactly homeopathy but u r right about the general truth about faith and such prevailing everywhere around the globe why blame just India Eg we know the US is an advanced market hi GDPCapita low population densitynow think about the number of Joes and Janes believing in so many different cults ancestral myths Aliens are kept captive in Area 51 hardcore Catholics mystical wellness therapy etc etc<new>Is it true that homeopathy is just based on placebo effect<new>Not just homeopathy people believe in magic too The age of magic never ended in India  The magical powder men the magical sound and smoke men they are all here   Things are so sad and people so desperate to believe  it is almost criminal not to take their money<new>Is this your account Liverdoc<new>Not just that but energies and a variety of mystic stuff     Im an American with lots of US Indian friends and you have to assume if they are in the US for college they are above average intelligence yet they will talk about homeopathy and energies      Some homeopathy makes some sense because they are just using the raw ingredient put into modern medications but its still less concentratedeffective<new>Its crazy I have relatives who should know better educated engineers or something in finance who believe in homeopathy Most people lack any sort of biological understanding<new>Fuck hot foodcold food mumbo jumbo<new>There is a reason Average Indian doctors suck balls in broad daylight They suck so bad that most Indians believe on more than one alternative medicine<new>Child didn’t die of cancer though<new>alternative medicine works for small things    Eastern medicine was way better that western medicine back in the medieval era<new>My maternal grandma whos my most treasured does so religiously n I dont have the heart in me to tell her its all placebo 😭<new>Look before homeopathy people abused antibiotics harming everyone At least now theyre only a danger to themselves And in the case they just have a flu and want to take a placebo its better for them to take homeopathic medicines while they wait it out  at least it wont upset their stomach<new>I think its the difference bw good doctor and bad Even modern medicine doctors fuck up and don’t give good medicine or treatment but some good homeopathy doctor who actually know their stuff end up curing it   I had a wart on my thumb i went to modern medicine they did operation and cut it off 1 month later  wart was back Went to homeopathy cured in 1 month<new>Trust me from my 10 years of using Homeopathy it actually works I dont wanna talk about this more but I just wanna people know Homeopathy medicines can actually cure normal diseases<new>TBF this is even worse in China because they have TCM which kills endangered animals on superstition<new>irony is how an even smaller percentage of the population can understand how utterly stupid this post or argument is fml 🤦<new>I’m so happy this is near the top if it wasn’t I would cry myself to sleep<new>The no of people not seeing the flair taking it seriously and arguing makes this post even more realistic D<new>How did an average man surveyed How big was the sample size Who provided the data Where is the reference for you assumptions<new>It is alarming that vast majority in a left wing

insufficiencies For those who are saying education can make us any better its highly subjective Prime example is that Bengaluru CEO incident To me even before education a child needs to develop critical thinking and in a country where parents are worshipped and put on the same pedestal as gods  the ideal idols  its highly doubtful that a child can think otherwise from the nonsensical religious and political bullshit theyre fed in their formative years No person is born andbhakt Its the atmosphere around the and their parents thinking discussions political inclination etc that shape their own And it is to not say you shouldnt respect your parents Ofc you should but you should know where to draw the line this does not go for all parents obv<new>Voting should have score system A very intelligent person within a certain margin of iq would have 10 score and a very stupid individual will have 1 score an average person would have 5 score Their votes will weigh differently someones vote might have 10 point the highest and someone elses might have 73 or 42 or 19 And each person must mention their score in every social media profile they have the higher

by top 10 you meant in terms of intelligence<new>I just want to add some information on Omega 3 Fish are rich in Omega 3 no doubt But fish do not produce it themselves they get it from algae and it goes up the food chain This means that the richest sources of omega 3 are higher up on the food chain in terms of things they have eaten to get there It does not necessarily mean sharks are the top   This is all true and good but due to the pollution we have caused in the oceans and literally everywhere else this also means that with higher omega3 we are going to be getting higher levels of micro plastics mercury and any other harmful elements   I eat fish and macarel is my favourite one of the highest in omega3 but I know the risks associated with eating it    100g of mackerel contains 5134mg Omega 3 whereas 100g of chia seeds have 18g<new>MemesSatireOC<new>I would like to point out two baseless assumptions they made in their mathematical proof      • Knowing the bell curve pushes you into the top 10 intellectually    Imo intellect isnt always a mathematical intellect people can be smart in their day to day decision making and have no idea about documented mathematics     • The things about average person    the midway point is the mean of population and the assumptions for a hypothetical person with intelligence in middle of a curve for a scalea scale that cant be properly defined is just baseless Its normal human behaviour to not doubt things were getting told repeatedly it is how our brains function to minimize effort Instead of doubting their intelligence its better to criticize the environments they grow up in As the comment before me points out this would be true for distribution of any countrywith some exceptions of course          Finally your observation is skewed because you only remember the exceptional things you see your brain forgets all the mundane and normal stuff making the distribution feel like its skewed towards the content youre consuming irl and on social media     Let me know if anything seems wrong in what I said  Thank you for coming to my Ted talk see you at the same time next Friday    Till then keep mathing on<new>The point is that though an average Indian is as smart as lets say an average American the number of people below average in India is naturally 45 times higher which makes us and everyone think that we are full of stupid people<new>ITS LITERALLY LABELED AS SATIRE HOW ARE U GUYS GETTING SO OFFENDED OVER NOTHING XD<new>You failed to understand the point of this post Due to the sheer amount of people we have the normal distribution has that much more effect  I hope you realise that the below average part of our society is twice the US population Normal distribution is part of statistics btw just because you

IQ is not a proper measure of intellect IQ moreso represents your ability to memorise patterns and learn from them  I do agree though the post is bullshit<new>Okay I get your point but it is indeed a

slide Sorry bro not the right place<new>wtf  In a normal distribution half the population is always lower than the average Thats not something unique to India Youre just trying to make a point that doesnt exist  You inserted maths in there just to make it sound believable but there are a grand total of ZERO stats in there Also how can you say that Indias IQ not that IQ is a great measurement tool is normally distributed and not skewed  Also read up on the child drowning in the Ganga case before talking about it with such confidence The child had terminal cancer AIIMS doctors had given up there was no hope Dipping the child in the Ganga was the parents last cry for help Also the cause of death was not listed as drowning So its quite possible that the child had already died and the parents took him to the Ganga as a last resort for a desperate mind  Not saying India is full of intelligent and civilized people but your post is just pure bullshit  All this makes me think that you are one of the people you are trying to call out in this post<new>Smartness is a function of IQ  IQ is a function of brain power   Brain power depends on Diet and genetics  Diet depends on lifestyle and cultural choices  Cultural preferences depends on well an individuals upbringing  Parenting and upbringing is dependent on IQ and more importantly the EQ of parents   A persons emotional range and thoughts are influenced by their beliefs  Beliefs are reinforced by religious and cultural setup   Religion and culture are a function of historical legacy  History is dependent on geography  How we are shaped is a product of n number of factors   OP explored just few of them Which I believe can be improved and altered by deliberate policy interventions by the government in education and health

explaining his image of current india and asking who else agree with him<new>You really did some great illustrations but honestly as morbid as it sounds I dont think education especially the Indian kind of education is key I know so many highly educated people with Masters in elite universities support the regressive ideologies One could argue that literacy  education but even people who have traveled extensively have managed to disappoint me when it comes to their political beliefs The current situation in Palestine is the biggest example of how so called education fails   Also my opinion is that intelligence much like the concept of beauty is a very vague metric A person considered intelligent in an urban setting might be absolutely dumbfounded in a rural setting  What we all could do with in this world is more empathy<new>OP just found that there exists normal distribution and wanted to put it to use  Made clown of himself Heights of stupidity<new>Iska source koi hai

from vodoolikeevil spirit sources and he said it is a common occurrence for people to think that way  is this true<new>It takes a lot of nerve to pile such a crap of a story with stats 700 million

educated or uneducated a population of 14 billion is or where the baseline for average smartness is 700 million people would always be below the average person Thats how statistics work<new>The fact that mughals had burnt around 3 lakh books and had destroyed and looted a India where there was a school for every 100 kids that India is now mentally ill and there is no proper nutrition nor is our genes able to process it because of continuous 200 years of torture even though older generations were actually not that smart leading to superstition but still the way English and Mughal have affected the longer generations of India is frightening and will remain a horror to me infact I have seen people with 2 brain cell compare themselves with illiterate rural Indians obviously they are smart enough to understand the fact that they cant access education and even if they would our education is more over memorizing so thanks<new>I agree with you despite the indignation a lot of guys demo here This is actually right but it doesnt align with their views<new>The populace is stupid and gullible everywhere In any country of the world a proper political consultant can create a campaign for you that will win you votes by exploiting the stupidity of the common man  The ones you have to look out for are the intelligent ones among us the top 50 of the curve who knowingly promote idiotic bigoted parties like BJP and Shiv Sena because it either helps us or appeals to our bigoted vices   Stupid people are not alone in this quest to destroy India they are being led by some of the smartest people in the room<new>This is so depressing<new>Doesnt China still have the largest population<new>Why is Noone talking about faith A religion crazed nation like ours i dont know why people

have been carried by the West We didnt invent anything after 0 The West invented aircraft cars telephones the internet and now AI Since the liberalization of the economy we are catching up in speed Its actually been only 30 years or so Ours is still a primitive society<new>Font name<new>Education will not change any thing untill mentality and ideology of people changes Only good book can do that and no one will make time to read book in generation of reels and shots So dont be surprised if this curve become negative exponential distribution in future with average people at the farthest right of curve<new>But our curriculum is being controlled by the government I wonder what we can do about it<new>I think you believe you are better than most of the people There are more factors and context to a situation i believe i am not very intelligent or even above average but that doesnt mean my opinions dont matter<new>In this case it is not just stupidity The child had incurable cancer Desperate parents do desperate stuff when their child is in danger May not always be sensible or logical<new>I appreciate your post I feel we should talk about these issues hefted by our society You are right Not the IQ distribution portrayed but that education is important  But if we look statistically we have tread significant milestones in education access I personally feel that the curriculum has to be changed  Instead of adding polarising scriptures we should include human etiquettes and tolerance there Once that is attained science should reflect the world around rather than hypotheses and laws from decades before This will help us inhibit the lurking superstitions within a generation from passing on  Also my friend there is another aspect apart from IQ thats weighing in Indian culture and upbringing ranks very low on the graph for Emotional Quotience We are only one generation away from casteism though still present at parts Were basically emotional beings who value human relations and prejudices over logic and comfort But thats who we are The only solution to this that I can see is to mingle with foreign cultures There are things we can teach them and to learn from   If IQ and EQ were on par with the parents of that child we wouldnt have had to be condolent now Lets work for the betterment of our society and not just hope for it<new>Whats appalling to see in India is that even education alone cannot bring about a modest openminded temper Scientific temper Its evident that the reasoning of even many or most highly educated folks is messed up with opinionated views here Such a temper cannot be simply burned onto the brains by a wrote learning system An individual first needs to have courage to question and patience to think logically whats being fed to him only then he can use any of the scientific frameworks to strengthen his views Theres no free lunch most are trapped in their comfort race<new>Nice comment section But I didnt find one that spelled it out so here

the curve represents iq vs of people  no of people but I am curious  to what extent does available knowledge affect iq or does it affect iq at all<new>This is the right answer and as a bonus you win

distribution is tending towards a students Tdistribution where the peak tends to move towards zero<new>hay dude it didnt work on me<new>So are you a troll or just delusional about your own intelligence<new>More educated nations have elected dumb politicians which is an obvious contradiction This considers intelligence is one dimensional Newer theories of intelligence divide it into several categories social intelligence logical intelligence political intelligence musical physical Its possible to be smart in one aspect and underdeveloped in others Just education wont solve much<new>Very nice graphical representation<new>Bhai woh 10 nahi hota The significance level is set to be 5 and given it is a twotailed ttest on each side it would be 25   So to reject the null hypothesis that we are average indians you have to be in 25 on the either side of normal distribution in which case we would accept the alternative hypothesis<new>Bro its still not clear whether they

OP here suggest that the people in the country who believe in alternate medicine godmen and watch Kapil Sharma are stupid who shouldnt be able to vote A strawman fallacy to prove a point which isnt backed by any data whatsoever Consider farming as an example which employs over 60 population of India   A farmer who has never had any formal education is still really skilled at farming Their vote isnt swayed by the promises of temples or the hatred of minorities but by the MSP and crop insurance that is being promised by the  political parties before election so that he feels just a little more secure about the survival of his family       But since their choice in medication and entertainment isnt as elite as OP they should not have the same voting rights because OP thinks only the people who laugh at the jokes of Ricky Gervais have the necessary intelligence to vote<new>Yep its a holiday alright<new>What kind of shit is this One cannot be in the top 10 of the population simply because they understand what a bell curve represents This post sounds like something the bottom 10 would say<new>Narcissism overload<new>Soure Trust me bro If such shitty posts are considered facts without considering any primary or secondary data and just speaking shit which comes to mind then I guess the surveys and statistical experts are a waste<new>Basic rationality doesnt require high intelligence  But reason works in the context of information and this comes from several sources such as tradition what we learn formally culture and media You can be a highly rational person but if you are working off wrong premises your conclusions will also be wrong  Consider the case of parents killing their cancerridden child by drowning her in the Ganges Primafacie this would be an irrational act But the parents are working off the premise that the Ganges waters have healing powers This is not formally different from the premise that taking antibiotics will cure certain bacterial infections  Unfortunately the parents were wrong but how would they know that Raising awareness of false knowledge is the function of social activists and intellectuals But in India they dont perform that function<new>Education does help overall But there are some great flaws there too Even a university graduate still carries their caste on last name and believes in it<new>Ultimately  op is pissed that his fellow dumb countrymen are not voting in line with his ideology   Sure there are right extremist who use religion to maintain influence  But I can tell you the left in india is no Saint Congress folks are supported by the globalist class wef and you definitely dont want them in power Itll make india a colony of globalist again  Look at the fundamental destruction of west and its supremacy  They need to break the country and people to gain massive control   You implication that the 10 intelligent ppl in india is a deviation  Its not Its the bell curve norm for every country What I can tell you is not all 10 smart folks are going to vote left cz they understand whats at play And its bigger than local Indian politics The axis is forming<new>You literally have the dumbest population next to USA<new>Im not gonna lie I feel that Indians are one of the most dishonest Greedy and stupid people  I used to live in Germany during 6th class  But I am in Pune for JEE prep  Putting religious things aside People try to rob me every second People try to impose their world view on me   And I am actually stunned with Indian people Theyll listen to a gadha person like Arnab and call themselves ViShWaGuRu  Actually Every news outlet is just shouting Hindu Khatre mein Hai Muslim bekar hai  and when a Centralist News company like DW or BBC repots on India showing its bad side Indian people become furious  I feel that Every person thinking that India is Vishwaguru is kind of delulu  x200B  If India is really world guru Then why a Pune Chandigarh trains are cancelled and only option you have is either General or AC with 4k rupee ticket I can pay that but not a simple 20k salary wala banda cannot  Ryanair ticket from Berlin to London is around 15 Euros ie around 25k rupee and distance is 1100 km Indigo ticket from pune to chandigarh is minimum 5k rupee which is usually up to 6k8k rupee and the distance is 1500 km   math doesnt add up   And then those delulu people will show pride in Vande Bharat Okay its an achievement for Indian railways But then Vande bharat charges 4k5k rupees for 16 hour journey while pushing trains like Punjab mail to 24 hour journey wow<new>The real question is how do we defeat the apex predators that live in India  Aka trains and electricity lines<new>Okay Im from the top 10 according to your classification can you tell if homoeopathy actually works or not<new>Low IQ and lack of awareness are two different things<new>Karma farmer<new>Everytime I get sick I get cured by homeopathy Does that mean<new>As a person with

like to say something here  It’s about Homeopathy All our family including me follows homeopathy It’s cheap it has no side effects and it cures our deceases every single time   Now are you saying we

real<new>Intelligence is relative subjective and not fixed That is why the graph is a very generalised representation not accurate    Relative  A businessman is much more intelligent in his trade than a software developer and viceversa   Subjective  Certain traits are favoured more than others So on superficial level we might judge someone intelligent or dumb based on our preferences A rich person is followed more and admired more than those who try to save the earth by living a minimalistic Nice guys are also another good example where their good hearted nature is perceived as naiveness   Not fixed  The story of kalidasa and his wife is a good example Intelligence only improves if you keep learning and it can reduce when you get complacent fixated and emotionally attached to an idea or event<new>HeShe Babas good women What bro  Wats App  Blud are you sure youre in the right half of the bell curve<new>for diseases that just come out of nowhere like fever coldwhich needs fast and good cure Conventional Allopathy medicine is preferred  If you wanna go into a looong and slow physical wellbeing transformation Homeopathy is prefferedwith all the diet regulations your medical

heaven knows india needs more selfaware people like this if it wants to stand a chance of getting better  I still believe india has the potential to be better if the ones keeping it down are removed or educated and they actually take action  I dont want india to be like china and NK spreading fake propaganda inside and out of the country that it is developing or becoming like US and will exceed it  I want india to genuinely rise up to become a first world country like Japan and Singapore did<new>Its always great when people get more smarter<new>How does Homeopathic medicine equals to

              " ' bad  Noding head means acknowledging   Indian culture don’t have a thing to say thank you as often as in west When you are serving them they see it’s your job and for all practical purposes there no need to saying thanks This doesn’t mean that they disrespect you I say thank you every time I interact with a service employee but that’s a learned skill  Not flushing toilets is not an Indian thing they might just have forgotten Not an excuse but that could have happened    About wet toilets The toilets in India are wet same in Vietnam So a dry toilet is not a thing wet toilet doesn’t mean a dirty toilet in Indian culture I hate wet toilets but I can image why this is not a big deal with them  About compliance of rule they are just dick heads for not following it They will push the boundaries of rules just to test how mush they can get away with Absolute shits<new>Why are you expecting everybody to thank you for just doing your job You get paid for servicing the customers and they have already paid for the tickets and the service that you provide I always say please and thank you to anybody and everybody but you expecting people to thank you for just doing your job is ridiculous and seriously entitled IMO<new>you get paid to deal with people If youre struggling please resign<new>removed<new>removed<new>removed<new>Please and thank you for us are words which arent said frequently They are spoken only when we really mean it English speakers say these words just like that For every little things i have seen native speakers say please and thank you This completely ruins the depth of these words for Indians   You are a Flight Attendent and it is your job to service passengers Expecting them to say please and thank you to you is a native speaker expectation from you but not a necessity You can have an opinion that this is rude but it isnt a factual statement and i would highly disagree with you Imagine being called rude for minding my own business and asking for service which I paid for Flight attendant judging me cuz i didnt say please and thank you is a kind of snowflake i would not like to have too as an attendant in the first place   Is it a cultural think to be a snowflake in native english speaker Maybe not but majority are and i am tired of them<new>Karma farming Downvoting this Clearly the OP is an Indian<new>removed<new>I

cleaners in America and they are also by far the rudest most entitled customers I have as well They fight with me on all the prices and tell me how cheap things are in India like that has any bearing on my prices They bring in the most trashed items and if they don’t turn out perfect like brand new they demand I replace their 10 year old worn out shit with a brand new piece of clothing Like what And just last night I had an Indian guy call 3 minutes before close and demand not ask that I stay open late because he hasn’t left work yet and wanted to pick up some items And when I told him no he told me I needed to deliver to him across town…i could go on for days I love all my customers for the most part but I’m getting to the point where I have to take a deep breath every time and Indian person walks in<new>They feel entitled because they paid<new>Im sorry for everything you endured and this is not a justification of those anyway but yes it is cultural We carry the 5000 year old baggage of the caste system and centuries of colonial rule   Perceptions of social hierarchy are a bit messed up here and the arrogance stems from that I hope more of us will actively try to relearn in the near future and I hope within two or three generations itll be a lot better Apologies for your inconvenience again  As for the not flushing part I dont know Thats really gross And theres no explanation as to why But is that THAT frequent I always thought it to be an aberration   And dont worry about the headwobbling its just something we do subconsciously it isnt intended to be rude actually it may be an expression of gratitude at times  And for your convenience the next time heres a guide if you want to know otherwise you can simply say that you do not understand and ask them to say it to you in words   ↕️  YES    ↗️  AGREEING WITH YOU   🔄  LISTENING TO YOU WITH ATTENTION    ↔️  NO   ⬇️  AGREEING   OR ITS THE CLASSIC HEAD BOW an expression of GRATITUDE ANDOR RESPECT  These are the most common ones If the patterns repeat intensely it often means a great intensity of the same response   ⏩ The head bow is never repeated Its often a gentle and gracious one time bow<new>Omg spare me I bet you are Indian yourself do know what the head bobble means and made this post to entertain yourselfexpress your internalized racism\\xa0 If you arent Indian shut up Focus on your own groups problems Maybe ask your supervisor for guidance on reframing your racist attitude\\xa0<new>Its common sense that it isnt a cultural thing  Its a selective group of rich entitled people Trust me these redditors commenting it stems from culture are the ones you are actually talking about lol<new>I am curious as well I am an Indian I am very conscious of my behavior in USA as this reflects the behavior of my countrymen Just a thought I think India should have very stringent policy when it comes to unruly passenger Sometimes I think the fear of getting finedjailedbanned might work We are not ready yet to enjoy the fruits of comfortable life<new>The entire world is rude Not just Indians Explore more<new>Id say more cranky than rude  1 Long lines at airport and all the procedures are too tiresome 2 Uncomfortable flight seats 3 Shitty food given as if it is gold  Air travel is costly and people are treated like shit<new>It goes both ways  air hostess and land crew are rude and racist  to specifically Indians  especially middle east airlines  You get treated as you treat others  Not excusing behavior of assholes  but just pointing out there are assholes on both sides<new>This is bait post by new account<new>Why is sky blue<new>They are trying to take revenge for colonialism by being an asshat I swear it be like that<new>Well not all Indian passengers would be like that but agree with the general sentiment Indians really are one of the worst travellers on flights and it actually has gotten worse over the years Unfortunately most Indians still believe that flights are an expansive deal and hence considering they have paid substantial money for the tickets are free to do as they please Domestic flights are even worse with people not paying heed to deboarding announcements talking loudly playing music with speakers on and not having control of their kids<new>I have seen flight attendants ignore Indians who are decent and civilized and I don’t go about making a post or stereotyping all flight attendants<new>Im dont want this to sound racist but    proceeds to puke up racist tripe<new>Its like saying every white person is racist or any other stereotype associated with any race or nationality Lets not lose heads and ask question in Na manner that is logical<new>I must disagree because there is clear racism towards South East Asian passengers specifically directed towards Indians passengers on certain Middle Eastern Airlines such as QA EI and KW The prejudice begins with the selection of flights and continues through the inflight service The discrimination against passengers with brown skin is not disguised but rather openly displayed<new>removed<new>This is actually a twoway street I have had to deal with extremely racist airline staff in UK and France when flying in or out Treats asian people especially brown skinned folks like less than human entities I dont want to go into specifics but I have had enough instances of this to comment that it wasnt one or two individuals who had this issue with me   While I agree that some Indians have an issue with compliance which may stem from lack of education upbringing or social cues like lack of dignity of labour for certain jobs we should also be mindful of the fact that some Europeans and Americans are extremely biased and have an unfounded superiority complex towards people from the Indian subcontinent   And since the only person whom we can change at the end of the day is us Im sure that the OP would check for subconscious racial biases and I would make an honest effort to be as socially pleasing as I can<new>I think you should leave your job youre pathetic<new>To all the commenters down in the post saying Lack of civic sense and flying etiquettes etc etc I have one question a genuine one who TF gives a class on these Are Indians supposed to be born with this You all are actually too entitled   OP the bathroom thing is actually gross and thats actually gross but in no way will I believe that the majority do that Except that grow up and learn to accept other cultures as well the world doesnt revolve around your culture only and they have paid for the flight and everything else out of their own pockets they are not required to get accustomed to your culture they are not required to say thank you or please if they are not accustomed to these things in their own world Yes we got that youre working in a North American airline grow up dude You might be doing a lot of work but youre not really doing it out of your own goodwill but for money Respect it and move on<new>Youre from London or USA <new>  No it’s not all Indians but it’s a majority of them when they fly   OPs either trolling or a racist Saying its a large number of Indians is understandable as Indians are one of the biggest ethnic immigrant groups in the States But majority indicates she thinks 51 or more Indians behave this way which is simply categorically false Only a prejudiced bigot would say something like that<new>Actually theyre all Pakistanis pretending to be Indians to bring bad name to Indians<new>Indian mentality is just bad the lower educated class cant give 2 shits about following whatever laws you put in place They think its your job to suck it up an deal with it Lot of cope here to protect this bad attitude lol  Its not a you problem<new>Not all of us But yes there are few ones who give the rest of us a bad name<new>Apart from the head bobble none of it is racist Its a cultural thing among South Asians<new>It’s a combination of factors   There is a general expectation in India of people performing their duties without being thanked for It’s not necessarily a sign of disrespect but most Indians won’t feel the need to explicitly thank others for doing what they signed up for   For a lot of Indians air travel specially internationally is a new thing and their expectations on how to behave might be different to other cultures or nationalities Japanese now their heads in respect but Europeans don’t but that does not mean Europeans less grateful than Japanese  There are rude people everywhere including India who feel entitled and show in their behavior and manners  For new travelers or people who don’t travel so often they might be nervous and don’t behave how one might expect from a seasoned traveler<new>A few days back there was a post on this same sub where a person was complaining why train’s washroom are not clean in India I gave tge same answer to him Its not the cleaner its us who have to maintain the washroom clean<new>NOW WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARGUED IN A RECENT POST THAT ITS OK TO NOT SAY THANKYOU AND PLEASE WHEN I COMMENTED THAT THESE ARE BASIC MANNERS You people are responsible for this reputation non indians have of us<new>It’s not always the case But there’s a general entitlement and lack of basic manners culture among rich Indians Especially those who haven’t been exposed to other cultures<new>Wait until you see a fist fight mid air lol<new>The one answer to most questions on this sub population population population<new>Man I must be living in a different dimension I travel numerous times for work especially to India I live in US But I have not had a bad experience or anything other than what would be deemed normal ever Few outliers here and there but this post makes it seem it’s like travelling nightmare every time<new>They havent developed the sophistication of the west Ive observed this everywhere Very few people know what gratitude is  very few people know what boundaries are just a bunch of unsophisticated animals<new>Blud you cant make this shi up  being an asshole isnt a national thing 😭😂<new>I have a different perspective here I’ve travelled quite a bit and work in sales internationally and I had to put an effort to learn the mannerisms I work in sales and hence I need to learn I don’t think others will put that effort Some of the people you encounter as rude are not actually rude it is just a language thing   Most of us are not native English speakers and our English is just our mother tongue translated to English   You approach an Indian for something heshe may say “tell me” No please nothing else Just “tell me” This is considered polite and acceptable in India but not outside I had to learn to say “ how may I help you “ instead of “tell me” The problem is in our language we can say tell me with respect and without respect  just like vouz and tu for French English doesn’t allow that When I speak in India I use “tell me” instead of “how may I help you” because in every day life that will be weird in India  Since in Indian languages we have variations for request being polite we typically don’t use “please” and we miss it in most of our requests as our requests are just translations   In short I’ll say most Indians are rude without them knowing  My personal experience  After my GMAT I’ve applied to a premier institution in the US for my post graduation The institute has a policy of calling the applicants and communicating that the admission is confirmed before sending the official acceptance letter I got the call the other line said “Am I speaking with Mr X” I’ve said “Yes tell me”… There was a looong pause she just mentioned that my application is accepted and I’ll get a welcome kit with acceptance letter soon and cut the call<new>Genuine question is there a Hindi word for please Never heard it or learned it in my travels<new>and after the airplane takes off they all get up and stand in the aisleways for hoursits a cultural thing<new>False sense of entitlement<new>Hehe what you experienced is just a trailer of india Travel by train and you will see a complete Directors cut with Deleted Scenes 🍿<new>Are you talking about international flights or domestic Indian flights A lot of international flights might have first time international travellers or hell even first time ever and to them its like they paid such a huge amount of money they feel really entitled Its a cultural thing for the majority of India when theyve paid for something they put everything aside Its unfortunate That being said it is surely a sweeping generalization because well were 15 billion and you surely havent met all of us  Im Indian and always comply with rules never stand up while the plan is still taxiing after landing in Indias domestic flights youll have half the plane stand up ready to deboard as soon as touchdown we call it premature evacuation and always say thank you and welcome But then again I had a relatively middle class upbringing where I was never raised entitled enough to be demeaning to service workers Will I want to make most of the service Ive paid Yes I will But for me that does not mean that I have the right to mistreat the people providing the service   India is also cutthroat competitive where how much you make often dictates how much respect you get Its often ingrained inside us while growing up that if you dont study enough youll end up a waiter or a construction worker both jobs may afford you a lower middle classmiddle class life in the US but in India youd be easily poor<new>Why do the airlines tolerate them<new>Old habits and worries anxieties etc from UK colonialism die hard<new>Have a friend whose mother works as a stewardess She said that Indians are the worst passengers and that turn the inside of planes into shitholes<new>I feel weird saying thank you and so do most of the people i know And I don’t think it’s rude and neither the people I interact with think it’s rude that I didn’t say thank you for a minor thing like bringing me a bottle of water or bringing me my food 🤷\\u200d♂️ But I have experienced people getting awkward when i do say thank you for something the other person did that’s their job Ig it’s just an indian thing 🤷\\u200d♂️ And clearly THANK YOU is a western thing  and 99 of our conversations happen in our native languages and i have rarely heard anyone say thank you in their native language to some waiter or shopkeeper 🤷\\u200d♂️ I’m not trying to justify anything just sharing my personal experience<new>Why do people not say please and thank you to me while doing my damn job No one is entitled to coddle you for doing the bare minimum And that snide you’re welcome isn’t helping your case here Y’all are also very disrespectful of Indian people and if you can’t do a service job leave No one is making you<new>Your observations are mostly correct Obviously it is hard to break this cycle Sometimes there will be cases where the crew is prejudiced and misbehaves with Indian passengers On some of the international flights I have seen the crew literally treat Indian passengers as young kids in school<new>How many Indians have you seen Whats your sample size You are making broad stroke comments some of which are offensive And since when did putting small items in the overhead cabin become such a big deal  But I agree with you on the first few points though Treating the people providing servicehospitality with respect is something that we need to improve<new>The problem with Indians not saying please thank you or you’re welcome is that it’s not a part of our spoken language In our culture one is expected to do their work Honestly speaking in spoken Indian languages these terms aren’t there at all It’s a cultural thing And saying thank you or please or sorry is a very official way I think you have experienced the creamy layer The rich and upper middle class The ones who are exposed to western culture often mix English words with local languages I’ve faced this issue when I started my career and I had to learn to use these terms and to say things like how’s the weather etc so that our clients don’t think I’m rude<new>You’re not being racist it’s a genuine observation and question No it’s not cultural thing I think Indians can be overly polite 90 of the time but there’s something weird about traveling in the last 10 years I think they go batshitcrazy It’s also a little bit of “if they can get away with this I need to too” BUT it also works the other way around I’ve flown on flights directly to India where the stewardesses were extremely rude almost racist Like I was in business class in my 30s once and at first they wouldn’t let me through until I had to scream at them that I’m in business class Jumbo plane so I had to walk up for biz class and I rudely told to go to my seat upstairs is not for me until I flashed my tkt at the stewardesses faces I’ve seen them being rude to people who just can’t understand them language barrier once I had to curtly remind a couple they are on a flight to India when they were shittalking and being exasperated by an old Indian couple I’ve seen one grab a lady’s arm screaming at her she can’t go across the middle aisle people are sitting there when it turned out to be her own kids The lady tersely told her to not touch her and she can hear her loud and clear without her yelling which totally surprised the Stewardess So it can really go both ways but I do think generally there’s this crazy pandemonium on flights to and from India so I try to avoid those type of routes I haven’t seen any particular behavior from handful of people in a flight though and i travel a lot<new>India is a big country with many different languages Also expecting people to communicate comfortably in your language is you taking something basic for granted I blame it on our school system which is not based on empathy but more like a military system Anyways We might find it difficult to say thank you but will help you when you need it<new>Really sorry you had to experience that Depends on the upbringing tbh Im fully Indian and I always smile and thank the flight attendants because they have one of the hardest most demanding jobs and its every passengers duty to make their stressful lives a bit better its the bare minimum I surround myself with the kind of people who would do the same  Also I agree most Indians outside their homes have a HUGE lack of hygiene But they will call you racist and prejudiced if you say that to them We have a serious problem with taking criticism and indulge a lot in whataboutism to counteract criticisms   Even my maternal uncle who works in the hospitality industry has seen an abysmally embarrassing amount of Indians interrupt his employees in the middle of their work and hounding them with excuse me while theyre clearly busy as opposed to waiting for a few extra seconds  India really needs to work on this I feel genuine second hand embarrassment hearing these stories in real life and online  The head nods are a very South Asian trait It can yes and no But I and most use it as a yes So I guess thats how you should take it as that ┐\\u2060\\u2060\\xa0\\u2060∵\\u2060\\xa0\\u2060\\u2060┌<new>Everything is correct BUT  I dont understand the rule of small items underneath the seat So a passenger who brings small item is penalized with lesser leg space while others who have brought luggage bigger than the size limit most airlines do not check get to enjoy  I once had a small backpack placed overhead Another lady came with a big size trolley The air hostess simply removed my backpack and after asking whose bag it is says please keep this down there I questioned saying the same thing above So I brought a smaller item and so I should be penalised and get less legroom She said sorry and then tried to make space overhead and fitted the trolley  my backpack above<new>The please in our language is mostly expressed in the form of how we address people Aappolite  respectful vs Tu informal  In English it would be the choice of Kind Sir vs You when addressing a person   The word Please is used very easily in English Its usage doesnt imply any favour being rendered It only refers to politeness   In local Indian languages Please refers to asking someone for a favour for which you will be indebted towards It carries a higher weight in society It is equal to asking someone Could you do me a favour in English<new>Now I don’t know if this explains everything but this should at least explain the head bobble  We have maids and drivers whom we interact with daily We tend to just nod when they ask or say anythingIt is somewhat standard for Indians to treat people working for them as an inferior since they depend on us The intent of the behaviour may or may not be malicious but the outcome is always hurtful and sometimes downright humiliating   Also many Indians especially men think they know better than an airhostess because she is technically a maid It’s a social issue<new>Again I hope this doesn’t come by as racist but it’s just simply an observation  Indians are not a race<new>There are a billion plus Indians on earth and a few hundred million of them behaving badly create bad stereotype for the whole of indians<new>So I am white married to an Indian In his language politeness is expressed though what you call someone and how you change the verb structure it’s sort of like how in French there is a formal “vous” and informal “tu” for “you” No one ever says “please” or “thank you” they say “give me that” “take this” “eat” etc But it’s not in a rude sense there’s just no equivalent word And I’ve been told that I sound very “posh” when I do use “please” “thank you” etc The head bobble is acknowledgmentthanks   Also not everyone learns a foreign languagemannerisms easily  As for the rest of your post there are always people who lack common sense and common courtesy There is a huge spectrum of mannerisms I’ve seen in India from very gentlemanlyladylike to extremely obtuse It is a highly populated country and I see more competition amongst each other than courtesy for each other here in general  Edit Also Indian cleanliness involves using water after using the toilet If you don’t use water after going 2 then your bumhole is “unholy” But it does get messy As a westerner I also get frustrated with wet toilet seatsfloors even though I understand Don’t know why the toilet wouldn’t be flushed though<new>I understand that it is your experience And I feel sorry that you had to go through it  That being said the gross generalization and putting a disclaimer at the end saying that youre not generalizing is very Karen like  Just as you dont understand the head bobble they dont understand the youre welcome The idea about what is rude and whats not is very culture specific and I can guarantee if you visit a middle class semi urban household in india youll be considered extremely rude for demanding your own mentalphysical space  Im not justifying any of the incidents but criticizing the way youve put it across That is very rude VERY rude<new>Class system where people think they are born better than anyone not in their classtheir dharma and karma made them Brahmin<new>Had rude Indian couple behind me force the flight attendant to unrecline my seat so their fantasies can have more room I was about to eat anyways but that pissed me off They also started shouting at the flight attendant for no reason<new>Kyuki Indians sochte Hainagar Paisa Diya hain to kuch bhi bol sakte hai<new>i was travelling on an air vistara flight last Saturday and a junior air hostess accidentally rubbed a lady with her food trolley thing during the flight That lady was behind my seat and she started yelling at the air hostess The air hostess calmly told she was announcing her approach anyways before passing through Then one boomer guy apparently that lady’s relative joined this conversation and started abusing the air hostess rightaway stating that she was too rude and her reply was not even polite He threatened her that he would start recording her and would complain once the flight landed The poor air hostess was in tears at this point and left the scene to avoid further escalations That same boomer guy later on demanded to remove his finished snack juice bottle before the air hostess started for clearing as he is not easy with holding the waste and the air hostess had to take them with a smile\\xa0 Honestly I believe some rich boomers are raised to think with a mentality that they can boss around anyone who is in a financially lower status than them They are unnecessarily rude and have no remorse or whatsoever on their actions\\xa0<new>I’d like to hear the views of someone working in one of the domestic airlines in India on this post   I can’t relate to what you have posted around being rude cleanliness etc in fact I don’t agree with your views  But I agree with respect to compliance Indians do tend to be one of the last to be seated and sometimes get up even with the seatbelt sign on I don’t do this but I admit  as soon as I hear one person unbuckle their seatbelt and we feel the urge to do it and stand up too<new>Youve got plenty of replies on this by now But it is also a topic of interest to me some from my own experiences and some from observations and some from mere hearsay There may be more than one reason for each of your observations  Assuming you are genuinely interested in why and not how to fix it because lets face it thats gonna happen in this generation sorry   Saying thank you and please This is just not part of Indian culture If you come across one that is an outcome of exposure and nothing else The ones saying these words may have been taught about this in the media working with westerners traveling etc while it is the right thing to do just dont expect it it is a massive undertaking to teach 14B people to say please and thank you the second way to look at this is propaganda growing up in popular Indian media it was shown like a bad thing to say thank you and please I recall someone saying Oh the British left India with that  saying please thank you and sorry do whatever you want and then drop these words and that just washes your sins away People would commit a fault which they could have easily avoided and then say a sorry in the end and walk away like they did not even feel it it was infuriating really disrespectful behavior so yeah the word sorry has turned sour here and the third way which is an important one is how an Indian sees someone working in the service industry to us a maid is the same as a server at a restaurantcheckout assistant at a grocery storea car driveran electrician and a flight attendant look at these workers like they are totally beneath you and they are there just to serve you like the other software you mentioned you have access to for checking every passengers citizenshipvisa etc if only you had a software to see what actually was brewing inside an Indians brain this is probably what you would uncover and this is probably why even if the passenger knows about saying thank you and please the thought in their head is oh but this person I dont need to say those words it is their duty to serve and take care of me I paid a lot of money for this so better keep me happy or else imma yell at you like i shout at my bai so the best outcome here is not someone actually saying those words the faster you lose hope on that the better but simply respecting you and treating you like their own   lack of compliance this is a topic in itself and this is not limited just to rules about carryon bags in an airline this behavior is rampant everywhere  roads queues when traveling in public transit at a movie hall or a large gathering in the classroom at work We just dont like to comply to rules I have no idea why only when there are consequences penalty fines jail time do we fall in line and this is for the ones who actually can read rules and listen to instructions in your flight though half of them are probably not even following what you are saying to them its like background noise one can say not knowing the accent in which a westerner speaks could be the cause here but that cant be everyone to some others it relates to what I said above why do I care to listen to this maid whatever shes saying its sad just saw on the telly about that door plug incident on the Alaska Airlines kid got saved because of the seat belt safety is very important and listen to the flight attendant like it is your first time on the flying machine every single time because you never know which one is going to be your last one   washrooms I tend to agree with the observation made here two reasons I can think of one Indians use water extensively when we go to the loo TP is very uncommon here maybe some star hotels have it but most of them have running water to cleanup whatever it is that you intend to clean so not realizing it is the flight toilet and not the one from your home lack of civic sense one wants to splash water all over the face maybe on the chest too while you are at it leaving a mess behind we forget these toilets are meant to be left as dry as it was before you walked in Oh hello it wasnt made tidy just for you we need to do the bare minimum to do your deed and cleanup after yourself you can get that top tier full service car wash when you go home The second reason is and I keep coming back to this one over and over again how you look at it your view of the object toilet is a dirty place to do the dirty deed thats what we Indians have in our minds so whats dirty deserves to be dirty So even if someone put the effort to clean it and make it sparkle let me go and create a mess It is very hard for us to accept even toilets kitchens bedrooms the street outside our homes is what we make of it if we want them to be RollsRoyce and if you are not British Cadillac then put the effort maintain and treat it like one but we dont and I dont see this changing anytime soon There is one point I want borrow here from what someone else said in their post this is a result of lowering the cost to be on an airline and bring on the common masses on board you just invited a very large population who have not been taught or exposed to such disciplined behaviors the outcome is not going to be good youre going to get mediocrity and that doesnt taste good   While the above are my opinions for why you may have seen these behaviors I cannot complete this wo saying this these days the behavior is mutual and it is getting worse day by day I may not be rich or have class but Im disciplined I respect everyone and behave this is very important to me But the way we Indians get treated on an airplane thanks to my fellow countrymen seriously fudge you behavior is not delightful at all Right from the stares I get when boarding to the look when being served the frustrated wrinkles on their faces when I call someone for a question or need help when Im boarding off even when I say thank you for your service and have a nice day I can actually sense that look of disapproval now that is attacking my dignity like what did I do to you Im brown and you hate me now because 10 others who look like me made your shift miserable go down that leftover Vodka I demand to be treated with respect Treat each and everyone like what they truly are an individual their personality is what they are made of and not their nationality skin color or language And one more thing Cindy Karens are White sowie I can never imagine a black Karen let alone other races Have a nice day<new>I think you’ve hit the nail on the head about the dignity of labour I’m IndoCanadian I’ve got to say that I have witnessed Indians behave really poor with service employees and I strongly believe it’s a class issue where service providers are seen beneath you   Random customer threatening to beat up a street vendor over accusations of being cheated Customer going up to the cook at the omelette counter at an upscale hotel and barking orders or a passenger being outright rude and impolite to flight attendants so much so that it makes me cringe when I’m next to them   The words please thank you excuse me sorry etc just seem to be missing from the Indian vocabulary<new>Saying Thank you please etc is not in Indian culture historically nor is the practice of it emphasised in schools or homes It is changing though at a snails pace Also Indians who can afford international travel always have domestic help at homes who do the cleaning and that is where the lack of cleanliness mentality comes from<new>Exceptionally articulated ⭐️<new>If you can tell me how to say please thank you you are welcome bon appétit have a good one in any Indian language I would accept all your comments To my knowledge the literal translations of these are almost never used in day to day conversations or maybe I just interact with inconsiderate assholes It is extremely weird to say kripaya dhanyavad unless in extremely formal situations Like when you are making announcements or maybe doing business transactions I dont know the translation of you are welcome and bon apétit is definitely not a thing The closest expression I know is eat slowly  which is usually used during ceremonial dinner not buffet but a pangat and the host goes to everyone to insist that they eat slowly  Personally I would almost exclusively communicate please and thank you through nonverbal methods in an Indian language In English I will say please thank you etc  Its a rather broad brush stroke to say that most of the Indians in flights are mannerless  they probably are but your answer completely ignores the cultural differences in how Indians express politeness and gratitude when they are not being assholes  As a side note I almost never receive a response when I say  thank you to a flight attendant on domestic flights in India 😂<new>deleted<new>Very good analysis sir thanks<new>This makes sense I’m not racist but when I have clients of indian decent sit down in my chair I am tense until they speak if they have an American accent I am much more relaxed I’ve been verbally abused by many clients of Indian decent and they were only the ones who had recently moved here I’m a hairstylist and they treat me like trash I had one man scream at me on Christmas Eve and make me cry he honestly ruined my holiday that year<new>Look we can rationalise our actions all we want but the truth stares at us in the face and it is NOT doing us any favours in keeping up our social image We make fools of ourselves and then wonder why we aren’t placed in the same league of treatment as other Asians or Europeans Why would we if this is the attitude There is an incredible amount of hubris and narcissism in Indians even toward others due to the power strata and that many Indians are simply raised in bad familial backgrounds and embody the same behaviours  I will accept that the previous generation was uneducated and uncultured and flight travel was a huge deal back then Our grandparents likely never even flew or understood that people serving them was just part of their duties and that they are also emergency staff But we can’t make excuses or cop outs any more Everyone has YouTube everyone has access to education atleast those that can fly and we have a responsibility to correct these behaviours It’s 2024 and people still carrying over colonialist mindsets thinking of themselves as the ever mighty customer is disgraceful  Dignity of labour is nothing but a respect toward others This is something that should be taught from a young age because children just emulate what they see their parents do I have seen enough and more parents actung like jerks not correcting their children cutting in line and not showing respect for others It’s all due to a lack of social accountability a social penalty and the chalta hai attitude where they know that no one will come after them<new>I think you are absolutely right However just to add dignity of labor is an end result or outcome not the root of the problem The root of the problem is untethered population growth You can launch 100 programs with good intent as long<sep>']"
