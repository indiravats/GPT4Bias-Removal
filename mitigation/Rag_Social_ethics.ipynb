congratulate any female i tend to add a bracket to say that i am sorry if my message was in any way inappropriate or i make it clear i am just congratulating on your merit and not sexualizing you in any way<new>Bhai tu gay hai tu nahi samjhe ga \\ud83e\\udd21<new>This post is screaming pickme boy \\u00a0<new>This is not just in India but even in developed countries There you are judged by how hot your GF is Male by biological factors are testosterone driven so sex pride etc are more on their mind compared to women who are more emotional Obviously you need to also apply the intellect to control and direct your mind but all humans are impulsive in one way or the other   The ratio of women to men is low in India compared to many developed countries Plus as a cultural thing not all girlswomens get into a relationship early Plus you add the shyness and lack of ability to talk to women in boysmen owing to only boys school or friends group adds to the sense of accomplishment  In India parents are not that open about relationships with their children so what they learn is from their surrounding This is also a factor<new>Plutonic relationship isnt a thing<new>In India In the words of the great poet and philosopher Shri M Bahl \\u201cEk ladka aur ladki kabhi dost nahi bann sakte\\u201d<new>Your title is wrong to what you described What you described is romanticising a situation not sexualizing   And its friendly banter among friends which happens in both male  female friend groups A boy talks to a girl  his friends tease him A girl talks to a boy  her friends tease her And if you think it doesnt happen in female friend groups then maybe you dont have enough female friends to know about such thingAnd if youre uncomfortable with it  tell your friends not to do so Even if they dont heed your discomfort  maybe you need better friends  And everything you mentioned from the art post comment to boys obsessing over getting a gf  what do you think teenagers have to obsess about other than studies friends and dating   Of all the things you couldve cooked up to gain internet points this is the best you could do lol Cook a better story or things to get mad about next

multiple friend groups with both boys and girls There were couples too Not every boy saw every girl as their girlfriend Same was the case with my college life So what are you on about  Maybe it\\u2019s something to do with your schooldemography So stop generalising<new>Why aah you gae<new>Im tired of these posts where people have experiences of a particular sex and they say Why men or Why woman Im sure women talk dirty things about us too when they are in a group setting and Im completely okay with it Stop generalizing this shiz<new>Send bobs and vegana pls<new>Go back maybe 100 years   Youll see that a woman was there only to serve her superhero husband and if possible to produce sons  Nowadays everybody is equal at least on paper  But boys are still brought up as little superheroes who later when with a girl have only one thing in mind having fun and show how much of a superman they are  Further in India many males find the traditional female dress the saree very attractive It shows the female body while hiding it   Same for all the jewelry worn by Indian ladies Pierced noses a bindi bracelets ankle chains with little bells which make noise at every step  All this forces a boy to look at the girl who passes by  And obviously the more the girl is visible the more the boy will be interested<new>I would add Indian \\u2018straight\\u2019 boys Lgtbq have different fantasies<new>Its important to recognize that not all Indian boys sexualize women and its unfair to generalize based on the actions of some individuals However its true that there are cultural and societal factors that can contribute to the objectification and sexualization of women in certain contexts    One factor could be the influence of media including movies music and advertising which often depict women in a sexualized manner and reinforce certain stereotypes about gender roles and relationships Additionally traditional gender norms and expectations may play a role in shaping attitudes towards women and sexuality    Its also worth considering the impact of broader issues such as inequality power dynamics and lack of education about consent and respect for others  women should also careful and dressed proper and dont wear sexlize dress or show body  Its essential to challenge these attitudes and behaviors and work towards creating a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of gender This involves promoting education and awareness about consent and healthy relationships as well as challenging harmful stereotypes and attitudes wherever they occur<new>Jee Prep  Thats why<new>This post has the whole nice guy incel energy in it     Whenever I M talk to a girl other boys congratulate me or something or say something absolutely weird like Im not as innocent as I seem   There you said it the problem is YOU because you come off as a creepy incel It doesnt happen with others who have a well rounded

thing something normal which comes with testosterone However not respecting women and thinking of them as just sexual objects is purely social conditioning While its normal to think that men approach women with only one intention disrespecting them to an extent where thats all theyre good for is inhuman and absurd<new>Listen to your parents kid  they are doing it for a reason you learn when you

2nd December Our sadistic anatomy hod tortured us for a year that resulted in this  People talk about ragging in medical colleges senior junior interaction etc But our seniors were really supportive and guided us for exams and all But anatomy hod threatened us on minuscule things 4 saal 1st year mein rok lenge not fit for technical education dekr nikal denge etc This haunted us throughout the year The fear was so immense that I cant comprehend it with my limited vocabulary  With nowhere to complain our friend Rajeev Ranjan who came form a very poor family his father is daily wage worker found himself helpless and committed suicide by hanging in his room  If he had someone to at least complain about the harassment by professor he wouldnt have taken such decision  Few months ago we heard the news of NEET SS AIR 1 committed suicide due to similar reasons why professors have unlimited power with no checks and balance  I know its an ama and probably not the right place for this but

but Im looking more at the explanation given by ECI and specifically how they treated RaGa since they mentioned they decided against pursuing any actions against top two leaders Back in nov RaGa called Modi a jebkatra and got a notice from ECI  but he wasnt debarred from campaigning or anything Could it be something that ECI actually decided instead of just favoring BJP  For instance if ECI is actually working in swaying election in BJP favor why would they do it ever so subtly Wouldnt it be more apparent like how ED has been used<new>Well it is what it is<new>You certainly have a healthy degree of contempt for the BJP but if you take an objective view the answer is yes The NDA is in a similar situation as in the Vajpayee years They have enough of a buffer that they can survive

other of being anti Muslim for instance and I suspect only part of that is aimed at seeking Muslim votes Theres a lot of casual anti Muslim rhetoric in TN in my experience and it spreads pretty far into Andhra and Karnataka Kerala I agree will probably be proof against this sort of pressure  But the BJP isnt significantly short of a majority in this election For the UCC theyll only need a few votes if the TDP doesnt want to make it work since they just need to make sure the TDP wont vote against it  Throw in the fact that Parliamentary procedure in India is a farce and youve got enough murk that the BJP probably can pass this With some minor tweaks I suspect Though my concern is that those minor tweaks are probably going to suit Indias conservatives on both sides of the religious spectrum Like the insane doubling down on criminalizing and over regulating live in relationships that the party has lately indulged in<new>Thanks Makes sense now Looking at the map i dont think CBN

your GF is Male by biological factors are testosterone driven so sex pride etc are more on their mind compared to women who are more emotional Obviously you need to also apply the intellect to control and direct your mind but all humans are impulsive in one way or the other   The ratio of women to men is low in India compared to many developed countries Plus as a cultural thing not all girlswomens get into a relationship early Plus you add the shyness and lack of ability to talk to women in boysmen owing to only boys school or friends group adds to the sense of accomplishment  In India parents are not that open about relationships with their children so what they learn is from their surrounding This is also a factor<new>Plutonic relationship isnt a thing<new>In India In the words of the great poet and philosopher Shri M Bahl \\u201cEk ladka aur ladki kabhi dost nahi bann sakte\\u201d<new>Your title is wrong to what you described What you described is romanticising a situation not sexualizing   And its friendly banter among friends which happens in both male  female friend groups A boy talks to a girl  his friends tease him A girl talks to a boy  her friends tease her And if you think it doesnt happen in female friend groups then maybe you dont have enough female friends to know about such thingAnd if youre uncomfortable with it  tell your friends not to do so Even if they dont heed your discomfort  maybe you need better friends  And everything you mentioned from the art post comment to boys obsessing over getting a gf  what do you think teenagers have to obsess about other than studies friends and dating   Of all the things you couldve cooked up to gain internet points this is the best you could do lol Cook a better story or things to get mad about next

multiple friend groups with both boys and girls There were couples too Not every boy saw every girl as their girlfriend Same was the case with my college life So what are you on about  Maybe it\\u2019s something to do with your schooldemography So stop generalising<new>Why aah you gae<new>Im tired of these posts where people have experiences of a particular sex and they say Why men or Why woman Im sure women talk dirty things about us too when they are in a group setting and Im completely okay with it Stop generalizing this shiz<new>Send bobs and vegana pls<new>Go back maybe 100 years   Youll see that a woman was there only to serve her superhero husband and if possible to produce sons  Nowadays everybody is equal at least on paper  But boys are still brought up as little superheroes who later when with a girl have only one thing in mind having fun and show how much of a superman they are  Further in India many males find the traditional female dress the saree very attractive It shows the female body while hiding it   Same for all the jewelry worn by Indian ladies Pierced noses a bindi bracelets ankle chains with little bells which make noise at every step  All this forces a boy to look at the girl who passes by  And obviously the more the girl is visible the more the boy will be interested<new>I would add Indian \\u2018straight\\u2019 boys Lgtbq have different fantasies<new>Its important to recognize that not all Indian boys sexualize women and its unfair to generalize based on the actions of some individuals However its true that there are cultural and societal factors that can contribute to the objectification and sexualization of women in certain contexts    One factor could be the influence of media including movies music and advertising which often depict women in a sexualized manner and reinforce certain stereotypes about gender roles and relationships Additionally traditional gender norms and expectations may play a role in shaping attitudes towards women and sexuality    Its also worth considering the impact of broader issues such as inequality power dynamics and lack of education about consent and respect for others  women should also careful and dressed proper and dont wear sexlize dress or show body  Its essential to challenge these attitudes and behaviors and work towards creating a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of gender This involves promoting education and awareness about consent and healthy relationships as well as challenging harmful stereotypes and attitudes wherever they occur<new>Jee Prep  Thats why<new>This post has the whole nice guy incel energy in it     Whenever I M talk to a girl other boys congratulate me or something or say something

thing something normal which comes with testosterone However not respecting women and thinking of them as just sexual objects is purely social conditioning While its normal to think that men approach women with only one intention disrespecting them to an extent where thats all theyre good for is inhuman and absurd<new>Listen to your parents kid  they are doing it for a reason you learn when you

2nd December Our sadistic anatomy hod tortured us for a year that resulted in this  People talk about ragging in medical colleges senior junior interaction etc But our seniors were really supportive and guided us for exams and all But anatomy hod threatened us on minuscule things 4 saal 1st year mein rok lenge not fit for technical education dekr nikal denge etc This haunted us throughout the year The fear was so immense that I cant comprehend it with my limited vocabulary  With nowhere to complain our friend Rajeev Ranjan who came form a very poor family his father is daily wage worker found himself helpless and committed suicide by hanging in his room  If he had someone to at least complain about the harassment by professor he wouldnt have taken such decision  Few months ago we heard the news of NEET SS AIR 1 committed suicide due to similar reasons why professors have unlimited power with no checks and balance  I know its an ama and probably not the right place for this but

but Im looking more at the explanation given by ECI and specifically how they treated RaGa since they mentioned they decided against pursuing any actions against top two leaders Back in nov RaGa called Modi a jebkatra and got a notice from ECI  but he wasnt debarred from campaigning or anything Could it be something that ECI actually decided instead of just favoring BJP  For instance if ECI is actually working in swaying election in BJP favor why would they do it ever so subtly Wouldnt it be more apparent like how ED has been used<new>Well it is what it is<new>You certainly have a

other of being anti Muslim for instance and I suspect only part of that is aimed at seeking Muslim votes Theres a lot of casual anti Muslim rhetoric in TN in my experience and it spreads pretty far into Andhra and Karnataka Kerala I agree will probably be proof against this sort of pressure  But the BJP isnt significantly short of a majority in this election For the UCC theyll only need a few votes if the TDP doesnt want to make it work since they just need to make sure the TDP wont vote against it  Throw in the fact that Parliamentary procedure in India is a farce and youve got enough murk that the BJP probably can pass this With some minor tweaks I suspect Though my concern is that those minor tweaks are probably going to suit Indias conservatives on both sides of the religious spectrum Like the insane doubling down on criminalizing and over regulating live in relationships that the party has lately indulged in<new>Thanks Makes sense now Looking at the map i dont think CBN

testosterone driven so sex pride etc are more on their mind compared to women who are more emotional Obviously you need to also apply the intellect to control and direct your mind but all humans are impulsive in one way or the other   The ratio of women to men is low in India compared to many developed countries Plus as a cultural thing not all girlswomens get into a relationship early Plus you add the shyness and lack of ability to talk to women in boysmen owing to only boys school or friends group adds to the sense of accomplishment  In India parents are not that open about relationships with their children so what they learn is from their surrounding This is also a factor<new>Plutonic relationship isnt a thing<new>In India In the words of the great poet and philosopher Shri M Bahl \\u201cEk ladka aur ladki kabhi dost nahi bann sakte\\u201d<new>Your title is wrong to what you described What you described is romanticising a situation not sexualizing   And its friendly banter among friends which happens in both male  female friend groups A boy talks to a girl  his friends tease him A girl talks to a boy  her friends tease her And if you think it doesnt happen in female friend groups then maybe you dont have enough female friends to know about such thingAnd if youre uncomfortable with it  tell your friends not to do so Even if they dont heed your discomfort  maybe you need better friends  And everything you mentioned from the art post comment to boys obsessing over getting a gf  what do you think teenagers have to obsess about other than studies friends and

boys and girls There were couples too Not every boy saw every girl as their girlfriend Same was the case with my college life So what are you on about  Maybe it\\u2019s something to do with your schooldemography So stop generalising<new>Why aah you gae<new>Im tired of these posts where people have experiences of a particular sex and they say Why men or Why woman Im sure women talk dirty things about us too when they are in a group setting and Im completely okay with it Stop generalizing this shiz<new>Send bobs and vegana pls<new>Go back maybe 100 years   Youll see that a woman was there only to serve her superhero husband and if possible to produce sons  Nowadays everybody is equal at least on paper  But boys are still brought up as little superheroes who later when with a girl have only one thing in mind having fun and show how much of a superman they are  Further in India many males find the traditional female dress the saree very attractive It shows the female body while hiding it   Same for all the jewelry worn by Indian ladies Pierced noses a bindi bracelets ankle chains with little bells which make noise at every step  All this forces a boy to look at the girl who passes by  And obviously the more the girl is visible the more the boy will be interested<new>I would add Indian \\u2018straight\\u2019 boys Lgtbq have different fantasies<new>Its important to recognize that not all Indian boys sexualize women and its unfair to generalize based on the actions of some individuals However its true that there are cultural and societal factors that can contribute to the objectification and sexualization of women in certain contexts    One factor could be the influence of media including movies music and advertising which often depict women in a sexualized manner and reinforce certain stereotypes about gender roles and relationships Additionally traditional gender norms and expectations may play a role in shaping attitudes towards women and sexuality    Its also worth considering the impact of broader issues such as inequality power dynamics and lack of education about consent and respect for others  women should also careful and dressed proper and dont wear sexlize dress or show body  Its essential to challenge these attitudes and behaviors and work towards creating a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of gender This involves promoting education and awareness about consent and healthy relationships as well as challenging harmful stereotypes and attitudes wherever they occur<new>Jee Prep  Thats why<new>This post has the whole nice guy incel energy in it     Whenever I M talk to a girl other boys congratulate me or something or say something absolutely weird like Im not as innocent as I

sexualize women not just Indian boys Whether you agree to it or not on a genetic level men feel the need to breed women Its not a bad thing something normal which comes with testosterone However not respecting women and thinking of them as just sexual objects is purely social conditioning While its normal to think that men approach women with only one intention disrespecting them to an extent where thats all theyre good for is inhuman and absurd<new>Listen to your parents kid  they are doing it for a reason you learn when you grow up   You\\u2019d think western ideology of normalizing

flight attendants talking about how they hate this route because of Indians having little to no etiquette Had someone crying to me about a window seat that I payed extra to book   The worst is  I was seated right next to an older guy in his early 50s and was trying to help them out only for him to ask about my caste and talking about his caste I heard from my relatives how they are going on Vacation so they don\\u2019t care about others whereas basic etiquette has nothing to do with being on vacation<new>Recently went to thailand \\u2026 and on cruise smoking was only allowed at back side  one indian group start smoking on front deck where its not allowed i was there with my friend which are from Nz  white  they told me why there are smoking here \\u2026 i went to captain and told \\u2026 the captain came and shouted at them \\u2026 like we already make announcements before leaving shore about smoking be will fine you if this happen again  after captain left they start laughing behaving like nothing happened\\u2026 i have seen so many Indians almost from every region staying here in Nz as well without any civic sense \\u2026 they will litter \\u2026 but here in NZ people are really outspoken if someone from any community behave abnormal they will call them out straight<new>I live in the whitest part of london it\\u2019s very quiet clean and nice I am very mindful and respectful of the neighbors and the neighbourhood they love us too I had to do some ganpati shopping so headed to Wembley Oh my days there\\u2019s pan and gutka everywhere loud music blaring on the street plates thrown everywhere Even the people are loud I was shocked and visibly uncomfortable There\\u2019s also posters everywhere to not spit gutka Never been there after that and decided to never live in an Indian neighbourhood<new> I think we should start teaching basic hygiene in schools like how to use deodorant Its so annoying when people dont realize how bad they smell and make everyone else suffer Also as Indians we need to be more mindful of our behavior in public We should be gentle have some civic sense and respect other peoples space and culture especially when were in a different country I remember when I was pregnant with my baby and it was my due date I started having contractions but the hospital told me to come later and that the pain was manageable So I took the bus home but it was so full that no one gave me a seat Not a single Indian person offered me their seat But then this young white man came and helped me to get a seat<new>Looks like everyone is the good guy here May be only the good guys are in reddit \\ud83d\\ude00<new>They have zero emotional intelligence And we wonder why nobody likes Indians<new>Honestly same And the fact is I am scared to say it loud because these days people are so much into religion and patriotism that theyre forgetting common sense and basic manners I travel a lot be it flights or trains I never take sleeper class or even 3rd ac in trains but these days even in 2nd class i am seeing a lot of mannerless people Blasting bhajans at 4am turning on the lights for the entire coach because they woke up Children crying ladies singing God it was awful but couldnt say anything because its bhajan and everyone will judge me\\u2620\\ufe0f<new>Thanking you for risking massive hate your way and spitting facts Its unlikely to change behaviour built up over the years but extremely useful to spread awareness so that maybe some will change for the better  Most of us grew up around environments where if we do not push and shove we cannot ahead People who tried to be courteous and polite got walked over Hence the attitude Its eat or be eaten attitude that is necessary for survival Its not easy to switch suddenly But it is something that we should leave back home and not take overseas We have such a bad rep abroad that as a group Indians are detested Thanks again for this post The fact that the flight attendants use balm to cope with our smell really hit hard<new>Not to be racist  but certain areas in India have more uncouth people than the others  it\\u2019s a cultural thing<new>Oh went I went to Vietnam the shuttle from the airport was full of my fellow Indians and they all started chanting \\u201cBharat mata ki jai\\u201d loudly  People were screaming and yelling at tourist places  The flight back was pure chaos The plane literally had to take off while people weren\\u2019t even seated because these uncle aunties were blocking the way sitting wherever they wanted yelling There was an Indonesian girl sitting next to me who was visiting India and she asked me whether all Indians are like this I was so embarrassed  An uncle started shouting at a flight attendant for some reason and put his food plate down on the floor like an uncivilised idiot  I feel so ashamed when I see how we all behave outside A few people are not representative of the whole population but it doesn\\u2019t help the stereotypes either<new>indians se civic sense expect karna is like mangal pe paani dundana  basic driving sense \\u274c basic travelling ethics \\u274c indian just wanna break rules and if they pay for something they feel like we are the owner and can do anything \\ud83e\\udd72\\ud83e\\udd72<new>Speak up We as Indians have gotten so used to \\u2018adjusting\\u2019 that we allow this to happen Speak up when someone cuts a queue speak up when someone is being inconsiderate Make them uncomfortable They are wrong you are right<new>Genuine question about body odour  I usually put on a good cologne or perfume in the morning but I\\u2019m sure through the course of the day it wears off and under the impact of sweat the odour can start I\\u2019m never sure as you almost always don\\u2019t realise the odour from your own body Now the question is what is one expected to do in such circumstances I may be taking a flight at the end of my workday not exactly smelling of roses Am I supposed to carry around a bottle of cologne to apply now and then through the day Is this what you guys do and if so where do you put it on In the washroom Very curious how the folks who apparently are always smelling good do this<new>Op can I ask which airlines did you use  I live in EU and can confirm this behaviour here as well Not just the airports or flights but even in other public spots I have seen Indians misbehaving at parks and plucking flowers which clearly say do not pluck and they encourage their children also to do the same I\\u2019ve seen a lady climb up a cherry blossom tree which is under protection screaming and shouting is just casual and nothing special at all Standing in the middle of the road and taking photos is just such a normal behaviour A month ago I meet with a farmer here who specialises in bulbs and seeds and runs major of his operations by selling them said he has the worst time when Indians visit his farm because they will enter the zones closed off for visitors they will dance step on the bulbs or flowers even after requesting them to not do it they will do it   There\\u2019s no decency about anything<new>Manners maketh man   This is very true Guess even education cant instill decency and politeness<new>Have you heard the common phrase \\u2018import the third world become the third world\\u2019  This isn\\u2019t rocket science man<new> As a Lebanese person I feel you lol<new>Not an Indian myself but I\\u2019ve spent a few months in your beautiful country and know many expat Indians in Australia Let me offer an outside perspective  Something that struck me when I first went to India was obviously the population density but then I noticed the social cohesion and harmony despite the fact there\\u2019s so many people Sure there\\u2019s some annoying traits spitting uncles yelling rubbish but I don\\u2019t believe those traits are any more frequent per capitaperson just that when there\\u2019s so many people of course that means the number of dingdongs for lack of a better term is higher  In many parts of the world you simply couldn\\u2019t sustain such a population without experiencing similar or worse problems Look at all dense populations around the world and they\\u2019re famous for rude people NYC London Rome China is a notable exception but maybe not lol   While lack of civic sense is infuriating especially when you feel it reflects on yourself on behalf of others to me it\\u2019s a natural negative result of a wonderful trait tolerance  Poor civic sense behaviours seem to me to be a direct result of interpersonal tolerance patience and forgiveness and a fundamental good will to keep the peace for the sake of cohesion Unfortunately it can get out of hand and people start depending on that tolerance to get away with shitty behaviour but it strikes me<sep>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

are low prio during admissions Im not saying they dont get in They get lower priority which is not an issue in the other places listed Feel free to also compare cost of higher education in North America to Western Europe and Australia  Im stating there are better places for immigration at this current time Socialized healthcare means youre not reliant on your job for healthcare Best of all Western Europe and Australia have no atwill employment<new>No one is fighting It is important to clear up this kind of misinformation as wrong decisions related to migration can ruin lives and leave

significantly better than my friends and colleagues in the USA spending 15 to 2 times our monthly expenditure  Healthcare is free You dont pay for prescribed medicine but a per prescription costunless youre exempt for age or earning bracket which is £965  There are free Grammar schools for highperforming students so you dont have to go to private school for an above average education University is considerably cheaper in the UK If you manage citizenship before enrolling £9k or £15£18k for international students  Social securities are amazing too Although people scamming the system make

Eating out is a big thing everywhere Please make an effort to eat meat Please 🙏<new>Valid concerns but how would you educate yourself about the behaviors of western culture It takes time to learn understand and develop the behaviors Most of them that pass through the learning curve are very much integrated but some don’t give a shit about this Those people are the ones who will be damaging our country reputation Put them on the moon they won’t change It’s a perennial attitude problem<new>Unfortunately those who should read this arent using reddit TT<new>I dont think this is only an Indian thing As a white immigrant from South Africa now in New Zealand I have noticed people from other countries all seem to stick together When we left Dad told us to remember we are guests in our new country We must accept the culture and way of life Best advice ever We dont tend to mingle with South Africans If I wanted to I could have stayed in South Africa I have grown so much as a person because I embraced the new culture<new>Im an Indian and Indians are one of the shittiest people on earth when it comes to civic sense and etiquette<new>Educated Indians are of the most closed minded people We still cling on to our norms and never question it We continue to believe in things like pure vegetarianism what’s pure about that religious dogmas importing Brahmin priests from india and somehow continue to be vociferous about our religion<new>And dont rape people Was  banned for calling Indians rapists But here you are raping kids and women You should be fucking ashamed Kid rapers<new>TBH Indians do a good job of adapting overseas Way better than a whole lot of other groups But it is always could to keep learning and adapting<new>COVID was hard on everyone  In my part of Canada when people were in lockdown there was a massive increase in police responding to calls about wife beating  The increase was all from recent immigrated Indian men    If you are moving to a western country woman are equals  If you hit your wife that is assault and you will be arrested the same as if you did it to a total stranger in public<new>Do you think they will listen to you No chance<new>Hmmmmmmm<new> first stop this then think everything else   httpsenwikipediaorgwikiCenturyInitiative<new>Exactly my thoughts<new>Thank you for this It is mind numbing why this is not common sense to a lot of us<new>Pretty sure anyone reading this here is not one of those people lol<new>Well said This is the kind of mindset anybody relocating to another countryculture should have<new>As an American I have really enjoyed the Indian people I have known When you say India it’s like saying America that’s covering a lot of ground financially educationally nutritionally and socially very diverse populations What I see is more a situation of people learning how to live in big cities with modern norms like social hygiene Every group of immigrants has gone through a smellyawkwardobnoxious phase It’s more about learning modern values You have a lot of educating to do kids<new>I would also like to add that whether we realise it or not the Indian body odour is a real thing We do smell different when we sweat Please make sure that the antiperspirant we wear is a good one and have a light layer of cologneperfume on Of course this isn’t gonna work if you don’t bathe or wash clothes regularly Basic hygiene goes a long way<new>removed<new>I’m American and I’ve had a few best friends that were Indian over the years including immigrants and first generation born here There is definitely a rift in values My firstgeneration friends struggle to feel properly connected with their family being more traditional Indian and their American friends I do mean in a very serious way If you hope to raise a child here recognize that your child may feel isolated and conflicted about many things I’ve seen it get very… dark for the child with them being unsure who to go to or talk about things sometimes because they feel like there aren’t enough people “like them” to talk to Counseling is advisable and probably more common for people here—it isn’t something to be embarrassed about either It’s normal just most people don’t talk about it most of the time   There is indeed racism but usually less vocal or obvious in the city People probably won’t approach you as much just because they are afraid of embarrassing themselves They might not know what is common in Indian culture It is true most people avoid being accidentally rude   You can bet your bottom dollar though a lot of people won’t stand for racism if they see it too I have had to tell older people to leave my friends alone from time to time—not only Indians for other racerelated things too Usually the people were just a little drunk and didn’t know they were being insensitive   Also be careful being alone including in the city Like everywhere people will target you if they can make a stronger assumption that you’re not a local or don’t understand local customs signs neighborhoods   Also the street addresses here go 1 3 5 7 on ONE SIDE of the street and 2 4 6 8 on the OPPOSITE SIDE of the street Don’t get lost be kind and stay safe<new>In Australia   1 Many times in supermarkets Indians will walk past you in the queue and go to the front  2 In the fruit section I saw a guy grab a banana peel it and eat it casually  3 Driving is terrible They will stop  slowly decide if this is the right place to turn or not and all the cars behind have to wait for them<new>Don’t stare at people and chew with your mouth shut<new>The Indians that frequent my gym use regular clothes like polo shirt jeans and black working shoes It’s like they come to the gym from work and workout with the same clothes it’s very weird to look at and make them sweat more than needed which also causes odor There are also some girls with full body cover that workout with their full body covered in plain summer I feel sorry for them<new>And stop messing with your smoke detectors That’s illegal in many states<new>we don’t follow rules as a rule this is extremely aggravating to the locals and many times racists use this as excuse to go after indians you can see this in reddit as well<new>It would be much better if they dont move abroad now given the peak unemployment rate and new strict visa rules If your goal is to get PR stay wherever you are now I came to the UK this January and let me tell you its not what it looks like Even parttime jobs are in scarce and life is becoming expensive here   On the other hand I dont regret much because of the welcoming population who are really nice<new>You dont have to represent Indians outside  In real life everyone cares about themselves  Its a fairly stupid thing to reperent your team or your people  You dont know them and you are not responsible for them period  Just worry about yourselves and dont feel embarrassed imo  Not all people are the same we are very different in and among ourselves  Learn to live with it  Also you are now in a new culture a part of it as well so you are also adjusting somewhat  I dont worry myself to death for the actions of others even if they are my fellow Indians  Everyone for themselves  took me a long ass time to realise <new>my very first embarrassing experience with indians abroad was in dubai we were supposed to be in line and the line goes through a rotating door where its a common sense that only one person fits at a time<sep>.

comparison to wage increases This is true in most developed countries but particularly bad in the UK compared to the US Canada and other parts of Europe<new>Why not  the Better approach is not to run away from problems when you cant fix them I mean why not run to abroad rather than facing those problems regularly   I mean how can a common person deals with extremely lazy trains  of railways when its norm when they know conditions of the govt hospitals and schools unlike the newspaper ads when corruption becomes part of culture 🤔 i remember complaining against staff of a so called multi speciality hospital in result i only got verbal abuse  Whats wrong in running away from problems when they become unsolvable all legal and illegal immigrants are trying the same  technique since decades which i found good thing its wrongly labelled as brain drain in media its not just india its cuba venezuela mexico<new>If by comfortable u mean upper middle class yes sure He has to still work tho Can’t retire on 50 lakhs<new>Whatever helps u sleep<new>Ever seen how people live They live with 34 roommates Roommates not flatmates<new>Very very few Americans work multiple jobs Real wages are high and rising Unemployment is the lowest it’s been in decades Housing is expensive in much of the country but far less so in other parts and housing is far more expensive in countries like Canada Even then real wages are higher in the US than the vast majority of similarly developed countries   I know I know Murica Bad etc but the data  and the huge number of people migrating to the states  does not bear this out<new>Come mierda y muere jaja<new>Oh yeah Wow youre impressively insightful And exceedingly funny as well It sure must be easier for you to convince yourself  I am not for real I guess it helps you stick more comfortably to your nonsensical argument Suit yourself lil bro<new>You don’t 🤡<new>Tell me the evidence you need name the countries you think have more illegal Indian immigrants than US<new>Cant really compare wages in Canada vs Mexico just because the workers are Mexican in both cases 20h is barely a living wage in a major Canadian city<new>Yep Illegal Mexican carpenters I talked to around 2007 in San Diego California were getting 20hr back then<new>it’s literally 0 lmao All european countries even Ukraine Belarus and Moldova have higher gdp per capita and gdp ppp per capita than India and the gap between India and the poorest country in Europe is quite significant too<new>Its like I am talking to a wall<new>It’s not about job availability It’s the ”image” fueled by society’s expectation They want to portray that their family member is now in the US and is extremely successful If one does another one will also want to do it because it uplifts their status in the society It’s a craze for these people they don’t think of solutions to their problems locally the first thing they think is moving abroad will solve all their issues It’s baked

constantly have to perform mental gymnastics<new>It’s offset by the Indian doctors saving their grandmas<new>Yeah its the same for being gay as well The majority of people in India dont even give a fuck about anything or anyone as almost everyone is struggling with their own problem Being atheist or gay can be used as just any other excuse to seek asylum<new>lol wrong<new>I agree I’m just responding to your comment about the perception that asylum has a higher approval rate than other visas  I’m sure there are people in that group who aren’t intending to commit fraud but who were lied to about what qualifies for asylum You see that a lot with Central Americans that people who charge to bring people to the States lie about what their “clients” will be eligible for<new>Going by general stats only 16 of MULTIincome households earn in the 100150k brackets The issue is the reliance on the insurance system which isnt a problem in the other places I listed because of socialized or subsidized healthcare  Youre ignoring my primary point the CoL and QoL disparity A friend earning 12lakh INR in Bengaluru has a better quality of life than a relatives in Boston earning just under 80k USD One lives comfortably at 30k INR per month the other would need to spend 45k USD for the same standard of living  Spending 30 of gross vs 6075 of gross  Recent documentation has proven desis are low prio during admissions Im not saying they dont get in They get lower priority which is not an issue in the other places listed Feel free to also compare cost of higher education in North America to Western Europe and Australia  Im stating there are better places for immigration at this current time Socialized healthcare means youre not reliant on your job for healthcare Best of all Western Europe and Australia have no atwill employment<new>No one is fighting It is important to clear up this kind of misinformation as wrong decisions related to migration can ruin lives and leave people destitute<new>Not denying it Hence I said Australia or Western Europe CoL and QoL are still reasonably decent in the UK but its not as good as it was prepandemic and Brexit With the new visa changes coming this year migrating to the UK from India will be a major challenge too  My wife and I live a super comfortable life within 3045 minute drive of two major citiesone of them being a Metropolitan owning our own house and with 3 dogs for approx £18002200 a monthincluding mortgage and bills Our monthly expenditure has risen by £300 since the pandemic ended but our QoL is significantly better than my friends and colleagues in the USA spending 15 to 2 times our monthly expenditure  Healthcare is free You dont pay for prescribed medicine but a per prescription costunless youre exempt for age or earning bracket which is £965  There are free Grammar schools for highperforming students so you dont have to go to private school for an above average education University is considerably cheaper in the UK If you manage citizenship before enrolling £9k or £15£18k for international students  Social securities are amazing too Although people scamming the system make

very serious way If you hope to raise a child here recognize that your child may feel isolated and conflicted about many things I’ve seen it get very… dark for the child with them being unsure who to go to or talk about things sometimes because they feel like there aren’t enough people “like them” to talk to Counseling is advisable and probably more common for people here—it isn’t something to be embarrassed about either It’s normal just most people don’t talk about it most of the time   There is indeed racism but usually less vocal or obvious in the city People probably won’t approach you as much just because they are afraid of embarrassing themselves They might not know what is common in Indian culture It is true most people avoid being accidentally rude   You can bet your bottom dollar though a lot of people won’t stand for racism if they see it too I have had to tell older people to leave my friends alone from time to time—not only Indians for other racerelated things too Usually the people were just a little drunk and didn’t know they were being insensitive   Also be careful being alone including in the city Like everywhere people will target you if they can make a stronger assumption that you’re not a local or don’t understand local customs signs neighborhoods   Also the street addresses here go 1 3 5 7 on ONE SIDE of the street and 2 4 6 8 on the OPPOSITE SIDE of the
